\section dev_code Code style

We have not enforced any coding standard. However, we recommend to adopt "best
practices" for clean, simple, and logical codes.

As the creator of C++ said, there is no coding standard everyone agrees on. Check out Stroustrup's FAQ.
A few coding standards are emerging. See a sample header file adopted by boost.org
- indentations: <b>2 space, disable tabs</b> 
- brackets
\code
{
  //stuff here
}
\endcode
- loops
\code
for (int i=0; i < n; ++i)
{
  //do the loop
}
\endcode
- class names: choose the name that can mean something to other developers and easy to grep
 - WhatIsThisClass
 - what_is_this_class

 But, do not use both at the same time, e.g., What_Is_This_Class is like using bold-faced, itallc and color fonts in a document.
- Local variable names: hide them as much as you can within the current scope, all lower cases preferred.
- Use <tt>astyle</tt> to format the codes, if your vim or emacs is not set properly.
\code
astyle -A1 -s2 -xe file
\endcode

\section dev_doxy How to use doxygen to add a document

All the documentation-related materials are in \c qmcpack/docs which has
- \c doxygen configuration files
 - \c qmcpack.cfg : generate full code documentation
 - \c dev.cfg : generate the master and developers' guide
 - \c ug.cfg : generate userguides
- subdirectories
 - \c ug : user guide - how to build, input definitions etc
 - \c tutorials : tutorials on specific topics
 - \c dev : developers' guide
 - \c tex : latex files, mostly generated by \c doxygen, some are committed to the
   repository with customization of the image sizes

To generate documentations in the output directory on the working system,
replace the directory names in \c *.cfg files to remove long directory names.
\code
STRIP_FROM_PATH        = /Users/jnkim/svnwork/qmcpack-trunk/src \
                         /Users/jnkim/svnwork/qmcpack-trunk/docs
\endcode
and execute
\code
make 
\endcode

It can take a while to generate user guide, developers' guide, tutorial and
code documentation in \c doc/output directory. \c output/doxy/index.html is the
entry point.

The developers' and user guide are prepared in *.dox files using 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html">Markdown</a>.
Simply add new files to the INPUT list in \c ug.cfg or \c dev.cfg and run \c doxygen, e.g.
\code
INPUT =  ug/index.dox ug/gettingstarted.dox ug/somethingnew.dox
\endcode
See an exmaple <tt>ug/qmc.dox</tt>. 

<!--
Each page has
\code
/** \page pagekey What is this for

\section seckey Something

*/
\endcode
-->

\c doxygen can generate latex files and \c tex directory has the generated latex files for
the user guide.

These layout files are used to customize the tabs and navigators.
- \c DoxygenLayout.xml  The main layout with \c qmcpack.cfg
- \c ug_layout.xml for the user guide with \c ug.cfg
- \c dev_layout.xml for the developers' guide with \c dev.cfg
- \c tut_layout.xml for the tutorials with \c tut.cfg
