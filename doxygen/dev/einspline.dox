/*! \page einsplinebuilder EinsplineSetBuilder

EinsplineSetBuilder is used by BasisSetFactory to create a single-particle
orbital set (SPOset) using einspline library.

It has many data members that are initialized with the input file and used to
extract a set of KS orbitals in the hdf5 file in ESHDF format.  The builder is
rather complex to support multiple versions of the HDF5 files, muffin-tin
orbitals and localized orbitals and to handle logical operations with the
tiling etc.

In EinsplineSetBuilder_createSPOSet.cpp, <c>SPOSetBase* createSPOSet(xmlNodePtr cur)</c> returns
- an EinsplineSet (see EinsplineSet.h), EinsplineSetExtended<double>, EinsplineSetExtended<complex<double> >
- BsplineSet<SA> (see EinsplineAdoptor.h)

How EinsplineSetBuilder instantiates a SPOSetBase in createSPOSet
1. Get attributes from xml <c>determinantset</c>  or <c>sposet</c>
2. <c>ReadOrbitalInfo()</c> : the headnode obtains the basic properties of the orbitals from HDF5
 - <c>ReadOrbitalInfo</c> in EinsplineSetBuilderOld.cpp selects ReadOrbitalInfo_ESHDF in EinsplineSetBuilderESHDF.fft.cpp
3. <c>BroadcastOrbitalInfo()</c> : broadcast orbital information so that each MPI can do their job
4. <c>AnalyzeTwists2()</c>: check if all the necessary k-points are available to construct a supercell via tiling
5. Determine the precision, storage type (complex or real), truncation and create EinsplineSetExtended with storage type
\code
if (UseRealOrbitals)
  OrbitalSet = new EinsplineSetExtended<double>;
else
  OrbitalSet = new EinsplineSetExtended<complex<double> >;
\endcode
 - This does not create big objects, e.g., bspline table, but make data available for OccupyBands the subsequent operations. 
6. <c>OccupyBands_ESHDF()</c> (in EinsplineSetBuilderESHDF.fft.cpp ) for the working spin
 - <c>SortBands</c> (<c>std::vector<BandInfo></c> type) is constructed. It contains an ordered list of bands that can be used to create a SPOSet.
 - By defaults, SortBands is ordered according to the BandInfo::Energy (extracted from eingenvalue  /electrons/kpoint_K/spin_S/eigenvalues).
 - With determinantset\@sort="2", SortBands is order with this priority, the band index, energy and twist.

\section adoptor_sec EinsplineAdoptor 
EinsplineAdoptor is a base class and its derived class is a specialization for the types and storage policy.

- SplineR2RAdoptor : real einspline to real SPOset, equivalent to EsinplineSetExtended<double>
- SplineC2RPackedAdoptor : complex einspline to real SPOset, equivalent to EinsplineSetExtended<complex<double> >
- SplineC2CPackedAdoptor : complex einspline to complex SPOset, equivalent to EinsplineSetExtended<complex<double> >

The derived classes of EinsplineAdoptor have three template parameter, e.g.,
SplineC2CPackedAdoptor<ST,TT,D>. Here
- ST: spline datatype
- TT: target datatype == SPOSet datatype
- D : dimension
The most common usage is SplineC2CPackedAdoptor<float,double,3>.
