/*! \page dev_todo ToDo

\section todo_psi Wavefunction
- analytic gradients for non-local PP optimization
- single-precision for hybrid orbitals
- truncated orbitals with PBC and complex orbitals
- optimize composite SPOSet
- grouping states with the same twist 
- improve algorithms and implementations to construct hybrid orbitals
- decide how to specify excited states and excitations in general

\section todo_ham Hamiltonians
- new observables
- forces
- break up \c HamiltonianFactory

\section todo_qmc Drivers
- Need to discuss pros and cons of reconfiguration vs the
  dynamic population method.

\section todo_tool Workflow and tools

\section todo_comp Computer Science Development
- threading
 - plan to introduce \c VirtualParticleSet to handle 
   - moves on the sphere for non-local PP
   - other fine-grained parallelization
 - RQMC and correlated sampling drivers
- MPI update
 - remove OOMPI
 - \c boost::mpi, if \c cmake can do the job
 - light-weight mpi 
 - MPI3 and RDMA 
- SIMD algorithms
- accelerators
 - A lot of features are missing on GPUs.
 - Will have Xeon Phi port
