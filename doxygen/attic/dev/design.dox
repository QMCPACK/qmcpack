\section patetrn Design Patterns
The main physical abstractions use the composite pattern.

- Hamiltonian

- Wavefunction

These patterns are widely used at the initialization stage
- Builder/Factory 
- Singleton

Schematics to illustrate how objects are instantiated in a MPI task.  Each
thread owns Walkers (squares), hamiltonians (open diamonds) and wavefunctions
(red solid circles).  The objects are cloned per thread before starting the
<c>qmc</c> sections except for read-only shared data such as 3D B-spline
tables.  

Cloning objects  is managed by <c>CloneManager</c> class from which QMC drivers
are derived. The number of clones is set by the number of OpenMP threads,
<c>omp_get_max_threads()</c>. The objects such as \c TrialWaveFunction and
\c QMCHamiltonian are expensive to create/copy/clone and they are instantiated
only once when the first <c>qmc</c> section is initialized.
