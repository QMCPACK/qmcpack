/*!  \mainpage Overview

This website contains per class and per file-based documentation and
diagrams for QMCPACK generated from the source code using the doxygen
tool. QMCPACK is an open-source production level many-body ab initio
Quantum Monte Carlo code for computing the electronic structure of
atoms, molecules, and solids, including metals. Designed with the
modularity afforded by object-oriented architecture, QMCPACK makes
extensive use of template programming to achieve high
computational efficiency through inlined specializations. Full details
of QMCPACK are accessible via the main site http://www.qmcpack.org ,
including the latest manual PDF at
https://docs.qmcpack.org/qmcpack_manual.pdf

Development of QMCPACK is managed via https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack
