     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes

     Reading data from directory:
     pwscf_output/pwscf.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PZ ( 1  1  0  0 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
