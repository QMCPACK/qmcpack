Nexus User Scripts
==================

Users interact with Nexus by writing a Python script that often
resembles an input file. A Nexus user script typically consists of six
main sections, as described below:

Nexus imports:
   functions unique to Nexus are drawn into the user environment.

Nexus settings:
   specify machine information and configure the runtime behavior of
   Nexus.

Physical system specification:
   create a data description of the physical system. Generate a crystal
   structure or import one from an external data file. Physical system
   details can be shared among many simulations.

Workflow specification:
   describe the simulations to be performed. Link simulations together
   by their data dependencies to form workflows.

Workflow execution:
   pass control to Nexus for active workflow management. Simulation
   input files are generated, jobs are submitted and monitored, output
   files are collected and preprocessed for later analysis.

Data analysis:
   control returns to the user to extract preprocessed simulation output
   data for further analysis.

Each of the six input sections is the subject of lengthier discussion: :ref:`user-imports`, :ref:`user-settings`, :ref:`user-system`,  :ref:`user-workflows`, :ref:`user-execution`, and :ref:`user-data-analysis`.  These sections are also illustrated in the abbreviated example script below.  For more complete examples and further discussion, please refer to the user walkthroughs in :ref:`examples`.

.. _user-imports:

Nexus imports
-------------

Each script begins with imports from the main Nexus module. Items
imported include the interface to provide settings to Nexus, helper
functions to make objects representing atomic structures or simulations
of particular types (*e.g.* QMCPACK or VASP), and the interface to
provide simulation workflows to Nexus for active management.

The import of all Nexus components is accomplished with the brief
“``from nexus import *``”. Each component can also be imported
separately by name, as in the example below.

.. code:: python

   from nexus import settings                   # Nexus settings function
   from nexus import generate_physical_system   # for creating atomic structures
   from nexus import generate_pwscf             # for creating PWSCF sim. objects
   from nexus import Job                        # for creating job objects
   from nexus import run_project                # for active workflow management

This has the advantage of avoided unwanted namespace collisions with user defined variables.
The major Nexus components available for import are listed in :ref:`Table 1 <table1>`.

.. _user-settings:

Nexus settings: global state and user-specific information
----------------------------------------------------------

Following imports, the next section of a Nexus script is dedicated to
providing information regarding the local machine, the location of
various files, and the desired runtime behavior. This information is
communicated to Nexus through the ``settings`` function. To make
``settings`` available in your project script, use the following import
statement:

::

  from nexus import settings


In most cases, it is sufficient to supply only four pieces of
information through the ``settings`` function: whether to run all jobs
or just create the input files, how often to check jobs for completion,
the location of pseudopotential files, and a description of the local
machine.

::

  settings(
      generate_only = True,                 # only write input files, do not run
      sleep         = 3,                    # check on jobs every 3 seconds
      pseudo_dir    = './pseudopotentials', # path to PP file collection
      machine       = 'ws8'                 # local machine is an 8 core workstation
      )

A few additional parameters are available in ``settings`` to control
where runs are performed, where output data is gathered, and whether to
print job status information. More detailed information about machines
can be provided, such as allocation account numbers, filesystem
structure, and where executables are located.

::

  settings(
      status_only   = True,                 # only show job status, do not write or run
      generate_only = True,                 # only write input files, do not run
      sleep         = 3,                    # check on jobs every 3 seconds
      pseudo_dir    = './pseudopotentials', # path to PP file collection
      runs          = '',                   # base path for runs is local directory
      results       = '/home/jtk/results/', # light output data copied elsewhere
      machine       = 'titan',              # Titan supercomputer
      account       = 'ABC123',             # user account number
      )

.. _user-system:

Physical system specification
-----------------------------

After providing settings information, the user often defines the atomic
structure to be studied (whether generated or read in). The same
structure can be used to form input to various simulations (*e.g.* DFT
and QMC) performed on the same system. The examples below illustrate the
main options for structure input.

Read structure from a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  dia16 = generate_physical_system(
      structure = './dia16.POSCAR',  # load a POSCAR file
      C         = 4                  # pseudo-carbon (4 electrons)
      )

Generate structure directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  dia16 = generate_physical_system(
      lattice   = 'cubic',           # cubic lattice
      cell      = 'primitive',       # primitive cell
      centering = 'F',               # face-centered
      constants = 3.57,              # a = 3.57
      units     = 'A',               # Angstrom units
      atoms     = 'C',               # monoatomic C crystal
      basis     = [[0,0,0],          # basis vectors
                   [.25,.25,.25]],   #  in lattice units
      tiling    = (2,2,2),           # tile from 2 to 16 atom cell
      C         = 4                  # pseudo-carbon (4 electrons)
      )

Provide cell, elements, and positions explicitly:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  dia16 = generate_physical_system(
      units  = 'A',                      # Angstrom units
      axes   = [[1.785,1.785,0.   ],     # cell axes
                [0.   ,1.785,1.785],
                [1.785,0.   ,1.785]],
      elem   = ['C','C'],                # atom labels
      pos    = [[0.    ,0.    ,0.    ],  # atomic positions
                [0.8925,0.8925,0.8925]],
      tiling = (2,2,2),                  # tile from 2 to 16 atom cell
      kgrid  = (4,4,4),                  # 4 by 4 by 4 k-point grid
      kshift = (0,0,0),                  #  centered at gamma
      C      = 4                         # pseudo-carbon (4 electrons)
      )

In each of these cases, the text “``C = 4``” refers to the number of
electrons in the valence for a particular element. Here a
pseudopotential is being used for carbon and so it effectively has four
valence electrons. One line like this should be included for each
element in the structure.

.. _user-workflows:

Workflow specification
----------------------

The next section in a Nexus user script is the specification of simulation workflows.  This stage can be logically decomposed into two sub-stages: (1) specifying inputs to each simulation individually, and (2) specifying the data dependencies between simulations.

Generating simulation objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simulation objects are created through calls to “``generate_xxxxxx``”
functions, where “``xxxxxx``” represents the name of a particular
simulation code, such as ``pwscf``, ``vasp``, or ``qmcpack``. Each
``generate`` function shares certain inputs, such as the path where the
simulation will be performed, computational resources required by the
simulation job, an identifier to differentiate between simulations (must
be unique only for simulations occurring in the same directory), and the
atomic/electronic structure to simulate:

::

  relax = generate_pwscf(
      identifier   = 'relax',                   # identifier for the run
      path         = 'diamond/relax',           # perform run at this location
      job          = Job(cores=16,app='pw.x'),  # run on 16 cores using pw.x executable
      system       = dia16,                     # 16 atom diamond cell made earlier
      pseudos      = ['C.BFD.upf'],             # pseudopotential file
      files        = [],                        # any other files to be copied in
      ...                                       # PWSCF-specific inputs follow
      )

The simulation objects created in this way are just data.  They represent requests for particular simulations to be carried out at a later time.  No simulation runs are actually performed during the creation of these objects. A basic example of generation input for each of the four major codes currently supported by Nexus is given below.

Quantum Espresso (PWSCF) generation:
************************************

::

  scf = generate_pwscf(
      identifier   = 'scf',
      path         = 'diamond/scf',
      job          = scf_job,
      system       = dia16,
      pseudos      = ['C.BFD.upf'],
      input_type   = 'generic',
      calculation  = 'scf',
      input_dft    = 'lda',
      ecutwfc      = 75,
      conv_thr     = 1e-7,
      kgrid        = (2,2,2),
      kshift       = (0,0,0),
      )


The keywords ``calculation``, ``input_dft``, ``ecutwfc``, and
``conv_thr`` will be familiar to the casual user of PWSCF. Any input
keyword that normally appears as part of a namelist in PWSCF input can
be directly supplied here. The ``generate_pwscf`` function, like most of
the others, actually takes an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
These are later screened against known inputs to PWSCF to avoid errors.
The ``kgrid`` and ``kshift`` inputs inform the ``KPOINTS`` card in the
PWSCF input file, overriding any similar information provided in
``generate_physical_system``.

VASP generation:
****************

::

  relax = generate_vasp(
      identifier   = 'relax',
      path         = 'diamond/relax',
      job          = relax_job,
      system       = dia16,
      pseudos      = ['C.POTCAR'],
      input_type   = 'generic',
      istart       = 0,
      icharg       = 2,
      encut        = 450,
      nsw          = 5,
      ibrion       = 2,
      isif         = 2,
      kcenter      = 'monkhorst',
      kgrid        = (2,2,2),
      kshift       = (0,0,0),
      )


Similar to ``generate_pwscf``, ``generate_vasp`` accepts an arbitrary
number of keyword arguments and any VASP input file keyword is accepted
(the VASP keywords provided here are ``istart``, ``icharg``, ``encut``,
``nsw``, ``ibrion``, and ``isif``). The ``kcenter``, ``kgrid``, and
``kshift`` keywords are used to form the ``KPOINTS`` input file.
Pseudopotentials provided through the ``pseudos`` keyword will fused
into a single ``POTCAR`` file following the order of the atoms created
by ``generate_physical_system``.

GAMESS generation:
******************

::

  uhf = generate_gamess(
      identifier = 'uhf',
      path       = 'water/uhf',
      job        = Job(cores=16,app='gamess.x'),
      system     = h2o,
      pseudos    = [H.BFD.gms,O.BFD.gms],
      symmetry   = 'Cnv  2',
      scftyp     = 'uhf',
      runtyp     = 'energy',
      ispher     = 1,
      exetyp     = 'run',
      maxit      = 200,
      memory     = 150000000,
      guess      = 'hcore',
      )

The ``generate_gamess`` function also accepts arbitrary GAMESS keywords
(``symmetry``, ``scftyp``, ``runtyp``, ``ispher``, ``exetyp``,
``maxit``, ``memory``, and ``guess`` here). The pseudopotential files
``H.BFD.gms`` and ``O.BFD.gms`` include the gaussian basis sets as well
as the pseudopotential channels (the two parts are just concatenated
into the same file, commented lines are properly ignored). Nexus drives
the GAMESS executable (``gamess.x`` here) directly without the
intermediate ``rungms`` script as is often done. To do this, the
``ericfmt`` keyword must be provided in ``settings`` specifying the path
to ``ericfmt.dat``.

QMCPACK generation:
*******************

::

  qmc = generate_qmcpack(
      identifier   = 'vmc',
      path         = 'diamond/vmc',
      job          = Job(cores=16,threads=4,app='qmcpack'),
      input_type   = 'basic',
      system       = dia16,
      pseudos      = ['C.BFD.xml'],
      jastrows     = [],
      calculations = [
          vmc(
              walkers     =   1,
              warmupsteps =  20,
              blocks      = 200,
              steps       =  10,
              substeps    =   2,
              timestep    =  .4
              )
          ],
      dependencies = (conv,'orbitals')
      )

Unlike the other ``generate`` functions, ``generate_qmcpack`` takes only
selected inputs. The reason for this is that QMCPACK’s input file is
highly structured (nested XML) and cannot be directly mapped to
keyword-value pairs. The full set of allowed keywords is beyond the
scope of this section. Please refer to the user walkthroughs provided in
:ref:`examples` for further examples.

  An example Nexus workflow/cascade involving QMCPACK and PWSCF.  The arrows and labels denote the flow of information between the simulation runs.

Composing workflows from simulation objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simulation workflows are created by specifying the data dependencies
between simulation runs. An example workflow is shown in :numref:`fig1`. In this case, a single relaxation calculation
performed with PWSCF is providing a relaxed structure to each of the
subsequent simulations. PWSCF is used to create a converged charge
density (SCF) and then orbitals at specific k-points (NSCF). These
orbitals are used by each of the two QMCPACK runs; the first
optimization run provides a Jastrow factor to the final DMC run.

Below is an example of how this workflow can be created with Nexus. Most
keywords to the ``generate`` functions have been omitted for brevity.
The ``conv`` step listed below is implicit in :numref:`fig1`.

::

  relax = generate_pwscf(
      ...
      )

  scf = generate_pwscf(
      dependencies = (relax,'structure'),
      ...
      )

  nscf = generate_pwscf(
      dependencies = [(relax,'structure'     ),
                      (scf  ,'charge_density')],
      ...
      )

  conv = generate_pw2qmcpack(
      dependencies = (nscf ,'orbitals' ),
      ...
      )

  opt = generate_qmcpack(
      dependencies = [(relax,'structure'),
                      (conv ,'orbitals' )],
      ...
      )

  dmc = generate_qmcpack(
      dependencies = [(relax,'structure'),
                      (conv ,'orbitals' ),
                      (opt  ,'jastrow'  )],
      ...
      )

As suggested at the beginning of this section, workflow composition logically breaks into two parts: simulation generation and workflow dependency specification.  This type of breakup can also be performed explicitly within a Nexus user script, if desired:

::

  # simulation generation
  relax = generate_pwscf(...)
  scf   = generate_pwscf(...)
  nscf  = generate_pwscf(...)
  conv  = generate_pw2qmcpack(...)
  opt   = generate_qmcpack(...)
  dmc   = generate_qmcpack(...)

  # workflow dependency specification
  scf.depends(relax,'structure')
  nscf.depends((relax,'structure'     ),
               (scf  ,'charge_density'))
  conv.depends(nscf ,'orbitals' )
  opt.depends((relax,'structure'),
              (conv ,'orbitals' ))
  dmc.depends((relax,'structure'),
              (conv ,'orbitals' ),
              (opt  ,'jastrow'  ))


More complicated workflows or scans over parameters of interest can be created with for loops and if-else logic constructs.  This is fairly straightforward to accomplish because any keyword input can given a Python variable instead of a constant, as is mostly the case in the brief examples above.

.. _user-execution:

Workflow execution
------------------

Simulation jobs are actually executed when the corresponding simulation
objects are passed to the ``run_project`` function. Within the
``run_project`` function, most of the workflow management operations
unique to Nexus are actually performed. The details of the management
process is not the purpose of this section. This process is discussed in
context in the :ref:`examples` walkthroughs.

The ``run_project`` function can be invoked in a couple of ways. The
most straightforward is simply to provide all simulation objects
directly as arguments to this function:

::

  run_project(relax,scf,nscf,opt,dmc)

When complex workflows are being created (*e.g.* when the ``generate``
function appear in ``for`` loops and ``if`` statements), it is generally
more convenient to accumulate a list of simulation objects and then pass
the list to ``run_project`` as follows:

::

  sims = []

  relax = generate_pwscf(...)
  sims.append(relax)

  scf   = generate_pwscf(...)
  sims.append(scf)

  nscf  = generate_pwscf(...)
  sims.append(nscf)

  conv  = generate_pw2qmcpack(...)
  sims.append(conv)

  opt   = generate_qmcpack(...)
  sims.append(opt)

  dmc   = generate_qmcpack(...)
  sims.append(dmc)

  run_project(sims)

When the ``run_project`` function returns, all simulation runs should be
finished.

.. _user-data-analysis:

Data analysis
-------------

Following the call to ``run_project``, the user can perform data
analysis tasks, if desired, as the analyzer object associated with each
simulation contains a collection of post-processed output data rendered
in numeric form (ints, floats, numpy arrays) and stored in a structured
format. An interactive example for QMCPACK data analysis is shown below.
Note that all analysis objects are interactively browsable in a similar
manner.
