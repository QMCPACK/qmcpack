Using this Guide
================

The Nexus User Guide provides an overview of Nexus (:ref:`overview`), instructions on how to install it (:ref:`installation`), an explanation of Nexus user scripts used to create simulation workflows (:ref:`user-scripts`), and complete examples of electronic structure calculations using Nexus (:ref:`examples`).  Reading all sections is recommended prior to beginning production work.  The impatient may quickly visit :ref:`installation`) and see the :ref:`examples` section for template calculations to begin using Nexus immediately. If you cannot find what you need in this document, contact the main developer of Nexus (Jaron Krogel), at krogeljt@ornl.gov (but please make a thorough search first!).

Some basic understanding of Python is recommended for Nexus users.  For a very quick introduction to the basics, read :ref:`python-basics`.  More information can be found under "Brushing up on Python" in the "Recommended Reading" Section (:ref:`learn-python`).

This document also provides a brief overview of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) from an applied perspective (:ref:`theory`) and directions on where to go to learn more (:ref:`reading`).  Consider reading "QMC Practice in a Nutshell" (:ref:`theory`) and the review articles and online resources listed under "Quantum Monte Carlo: Theory and Practice" (:ref:`learn-qmc`) before proceeding to the :ref:`overview`) and the :ref:`examples`.
