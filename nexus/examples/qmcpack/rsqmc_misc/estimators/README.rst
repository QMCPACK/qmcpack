Nexus Inputs for QMCPACK Estimators
=====================================
This example aims to illustrate Nexus inputs for all available QMCPACK estimators.
``iron_ldaU_dmc.py`` file uses bcc-Fe structure and Quantum ESPRESSO code for demonstration.
Only minor changes will be needed depending on the boundary conditions and the code generating the trial wave function.
For each estimator, important information is provided in the Nexus workflow as comments.
In addition, ``scripts_postproc`` directory includes some post-processing tools for these estimators.
