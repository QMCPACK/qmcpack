# NEXUS User Guide

This directory contains the LaTeX source for the NEXUS user guide. The
PDF guide is not currently created by the build process and must be
created manually.

- A script, build_nexus_user_guide.sh provides the current "best" version of the user guide.
- TeX Live 2017 or equivalent, or more recent versions are recommended
- Python and the python module pygmentize are required for the source listings.
