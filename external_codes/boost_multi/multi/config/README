This directory contains example build scripts for QMCPACK. We
recommend writing a similar script that records all the settings used
for any machine you build on.

It is highly preferred to configure cmake via command
options. Previous versions of QMCPACK shipped with toolchain files for
many systems, but we found them to be brittle and difficult to
maintain. Today, cmake has much better support. Use of old toolchains
is not recommended and is not supported.
