# [Boost].Multi

(not an official Boost library)

_Alfredo Correa, 2018_

Boost.Multi provides multidimensional array access to contiguous or regularly contiguous memory (or ranges).
It shares the goals of Boost.MultiArray, although the code is completely independent and the syntax has slight differences.
Boost.Multi and Boost.MultiArray types can be used interchangeably for the most part, they differ slightly in the semantics of reference and value types. 

Boost.Multi aims to simplify the semantics of Boost.MultiArray and make it more compatible with the Standard (STL) Algorithms and special memory.
It requires C++14. The code was developed on `clang` and `gcc` compilers.

Before testing speed, please make sure that you are compiling in release mode (`-DNDEBUG`) and with optimizations (`-O3`), if your test involves mathematical operations add arithmetic optimizations (`-Ofast`).

Some features:

* Arbitrary pointer types (minimal requirements)
* Simplified implementation (~600 lines)
* Fast access of subarray (view) types
* Value semantics of multi-dimensional array container
* Better semantics of subarray (view) types

## Types

* `multi::array<T, D, A>`: Array of dimension `D`, it has value semantics if `T` has value semantics. Memory is requested by allocator of type `A`, should support stateful allocators.
* `multi::array_ref<T, D, P = T*>`: Array interpretation of a random access range, usually a memory block. It has reference semantics. Thanks to (non-virtual) inheritance an `array<T, D, A>` is-a `array_ref<T, D, A::pointer>`.
* `multi::array(_ref)<T, D, P>::(const_)iterator`: Iterator to subarrays of dimension `D-1`. For `D==1` this is an iterator to an element. This types are generated by `begin` and `end` functions.
* `multi::array(_ref)<T, D, P>::(const_)reference`: Reference to subarrays of dimension `D-1`. For `D>1` this are not true C++-references but types emulate them (with reference semantics), therefore `auto` is not well behaved. For `D==1` this is a true C++ reference to an elements. These types are generated by dereferencing iterators, e.g. `*begin(MA)`.
* other derived "unspecified types" fulfil (a still loosely defined) `ArrayViewConcept`, for example by taking partial indices or rotations (transpositions). Due to language limitations `auto` will not deduce a value-sematics type; for this reason it is necessary to use "decay" to obtain value object.

## Concept Requirements

The designs tries to impose the minimum possible requirements over the used referred types.
Pointer-like random access types can be used as substitutes of built-in pointers.

```
template<class T> struct ptr{
	T& operator*() const{return *impl_;}
	auto operator+(std::ptrdiff_t n) const{return ptr{impl_ + n};}
//	T& operator[](std::ptrdiff_t n) const{return impl_[n];} // optional
private: T* impl_;
};
int main(){
	double* buffer = new double[100];
	multi::array_ref<double, 2, ptr<double> > CC({10, 10}, ptr<double>{buffer});
	CC[2]; // requires operator+ 
	CC[1][1]; // requires operator*
	CC[1][1] = 9;
	assert(CC[1][1] == 9);
}
```

## Usage

We create a static C-array of `double`s, and refer to it via a bidimensional array `multi::array_ref<double, 2>`.

	#include "../array_ref.hpp"
	#include "../array.hpp"
	
	#include<algorithm> // for sort
	#include<iostream> // for print
	
	namespace multi = boost::multi;
	using std::cout; using std::cerr;
	
	int main(){
		double d2D[4][5] = {
			{150, 16, 17, 18, 19},
			{ 30,  1,  2,  3,  4}, 
			{100, 11, 12, 13, 14}, 
			{ 50,  6,  7,  8,  9} 
		};
		multi::array_ref<double, 2> d2D_ref{&d2D[0][0], {4, 5}};
															...


Note that the syntax of creating a reference array involves passing the pointer to a memory block (20 elements here) and the logical dimensions of that memory block (4 by 5 here).

Next we print the elements in a way that corresponds to the logical arrangement:

		for(auto i : d2D_ref.extension(0)){
			for(auto j : d2D_ref.extension(1))
				cout << d2D_ref[i][j] <<' ';
			cout <<'\n';
		}
	
This will output:

> 150 16 17 18 19  
> 30 1 2 3 4  
> 100 11 12 13 14  
> 50 6 7 8 9

It is sometimes said (Sean Parent) that the whole of STL algorithms can be seen as intermediate pieces to implement`std::stable_sort`. 
Pressumably if one can sort over a range, one can do anything.

		std::stable_sort( begin(d2D_ref), end(d2D_ref) );

If we print this we will get

> 30 1 2 3 4  
> 50 6 7 8 9  
> 100 11 12 13 14  
> 150 16 17 18 19


The array has been changed to be in row-based lexicographical order.
Since the sorted array is a reference to the original data, the original array has changed. 

		assert( d2D[1][1] == 6 );

Needless to say that `std::*sort` cannot be applied directly to a multidimensional C-array or to Boost.MultiArray types.

If we want to order the matrix in a per-column basis we need to "view" the matrix as range of columns. This is done in the bidimensional case, by accessing the matrix as a range of columns:

	    std::stable_sort( d2D_ref.begin(1), d2D_ref.end(1) );

Which will transform the matrix into. 

> 1 2 3 4 30  
> 6 7 8 9 50  
> 11 12 13 14 100  
> 16 17 18 19 150 

In other words, a matrix of dimension `D` can be viewed simultaneously as `D` different ranges of different "transpositions" by passing an interger value to `begin` and `end` indicating the preferred dimension.
`begin(0)` is equivalent to `begin()`.

## Initialization

`array_ref` is initialized from existing contiguous memory, the index extensions must agree with the total number of elements.

```
double* dp = new double[12];
multi::array_ref<double, 2> A({3,4}, dp);
multi::array_ref<double, 2> B({2,6}, dp);
...
delete[] dp;
```
`array` is initialized by specifying the index extensions (and optionally a default value) or alternatively from a rectangular list. 

```
/*In C++17 the element-type and the dimensionality can be omitted*/
multi::array/*<double, 1>*/ A1 = {1.,2.,3.}; 
                     assert(A1.dimensionality==1 and A1.num_elements()==3);
multi::array/*<double, 2>*/ A2 {
	 {1.,2.,3.},
	 {4.,5.,6.}
};                   assert(A2.dimensionality==2 and A2.num_elements()==2*3);
multi::array/*<double, 3>*/ const A3 = {
    {{ 1.2,  0.}, { 2.4, 1.}},
    {{11.2,  3.}, {34.4, 4.}},
    {{15.2, 99.}, {32.4, 2.}}
};                   assert(A3.dimensionality==3 and A3.num_elements()==3*2*2);
```

## Iteration

Accessing arrays by iterators (`begin`/`end`) enables the use of many iterator based algorithms (see the sort example above).
`begin/end(A)` (or equivalently `A.begin/end()`) gives iterators that linear and random access in the leading dimension. 

`A.begin/end(n)` gives access in non-leading nested dimension number `n`. 

`cbegin/cend(A)` (or equivalently `A.cbegin/cend()`) gives read-only iterators.

For example in three dimensional array,

	(cbegin(A)+1)->operator[](1).begin()[0] = 342.4; //error, read-only
	(begin(A)+1)->operator[](1).begin()[0] = 342.4; // assigns to A[1][1][0]
	assert( (begin(A)+1)->operator[](1).begin()[0] == 342.4 );

As an example, this function allows printing arrays of arbitrary dimension into a linear comma-separated form.

```
void print(double const& d){cout<<d;};
template<class MultiArray> 
void print(MultiArray const& ma){
	cout<<"{";
	if(not ma.empty()){
		print(*cbegin(ma));
		std::for_each(cbegin(ma)+1, cend(ma), [](auto&& e){cout<<","; print(e);});
	}
	cout<<"}";
}
...
print(A);
```
> {{{1.2,1.1},{2.4,1}},{{11.2,3},{34.4,4}},{{15.2,99},{32.4,2}}}


Except for those corresponding to the last dimension, derreferencing iterators generally produce proxy-reference objects. Therefore this is usually a mistake:

    auto row = *begin(A);

This because `row` doesn't have the expected value semantics, and didn't produce any data copy.

    decltype(A)::value_type row = *begin(A);

In my experience, however, this produced the expected behavior without copying elements.

    auto const& row = *cbegin(A); // decltype(A)::const_reference row = *cbegin(A);

## Indexing

Many algorithms on arrays are oriented to linear algebra, which are ubiquitously implemented in terms of multidimensional index access. 

### Element access and partial access

Index access is almost equivalent to those of C-fixed sizes arrays, for example a 3-dimensional array will access to an element by `m[1][2][3]`, which can be used for write and read operations. 
Partial index arguments `m[1][2]` generate a view 1-dimensional object.
Transpositions are also multi-dimensional arrays in which the index are logically rearranged, for example `m.rotated(1)[2][3][1] == m[1][2][3]`.

This example implements Gauss Jordan Elimination without pivoting:

```
template<class Matrix, class Vector>
void solve(Matrix& m, Vector& y){
	std::ptrdiff_t msize = size(m); 
	for(auto r = 0; r != msize; ++r){
		auto mr = m[r];
		auto mrr = mr[r];
		for(auto c = r + 1; c != msize; ++c) mr[c] /= mrr;
		auto yr = (y[r] /= mrr);
		for(auto r2 = r + 1; r2 != msize; ++r2){
			auto mr2 = m[r2];
			auto const& mr2r = mr2[r];
			auto const& mr = m[r];
			for(auto c = r + 1; c != msize; ++c) mr2[c] -= mr2r*mr[c];
			y[r2] -= mr2r*yr;
		}
	}
	for(auto r = msize - 1; r > 0; --r){
		auto const& yr = y[r];
		for(auto r2 = r-1; r2 >=0; --r2)
			y[r2] -= yr*m[r2][r];
	}
}
```

### Slices and strides

Given an array, a slice in the first dimension can be taken with the `sliced` function. `sliced` takes two arguments, the first index of the slice and the last index (not included) of the slice. For example,

```
multi::array<double, 2> d2D({4, 5});
assert( d2D.size(0) == 4 and d2D.size(1) == 5 );

auto&& d2D_sliced = d2D.sliced(1, 3); // {{d2D[1], d2D[2]}}
assert( d2D_sliced.size(0) == 2 and d2D_sliced.size(1) == 5 );
```

The number of rows in the sliced matrix is 2 because we took only two rows, row 1 and row 2 (row 3 is excluded).

In the same way a strided view of the original array can be taken with the `strided` function.

```
auto&& d2D_strided = d2D.stride(2); // {{ d2D[0], d2D[1] }};
assert( d2D_strided.size(0) == 2 and d2D_strided.size(1) == 5 );
```

In this case the number of rows is 2 because, out of the 4 original rows we took one every two.

Operations can be combined in a single line:

```
auto&& d2D_slicedstrided = d2D.sliced(1, 3).strided(2); // {{ d2D[1] }};
assert( d2D_slicedstrided.size(0) == 1 and d2D_slicedstrided.size(1) == 5 );
```

For convenience, `A.sliced(a, b, c)` is the same as `A.sliced(a, b).strided(c)`.

By combining `rotated`, `sliced` and `strided` one can take sub arrays at any dimension. For example in a two dimensional array one can take a subset of columns by defining.

```
auto&& subA = A.rotated(1).strided(1, 3).sliced(2).rotated(-1);
```

Other notations are available, but when in doubt the `rotated/strided/sliced/rotated` idiom provides the most control over the subview operations.
At the moment the `strided` argument has to divide the total size of the slice (or matrix), otherwise the behavior is undefined.
