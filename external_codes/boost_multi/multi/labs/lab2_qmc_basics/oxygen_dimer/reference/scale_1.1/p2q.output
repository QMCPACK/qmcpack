 exclusive time read pseudo (s) 0.000000000000000000E+00

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = LDA ( 1 1 0 0 0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.00
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
