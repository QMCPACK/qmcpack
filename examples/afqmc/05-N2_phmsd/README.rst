Example 5: CASSCF Trial
=======================

In this example we will show how to format a casscf trial wavefunction.

Rather than use the `pyscf_to_afqmc.py`, script we will break up the process to allow
for more flexibility and show what is going on under the hood.

The qmcpack input can be generated with the scf.py script. See the comments in
scf.py for a breakdown of the steps involved.
