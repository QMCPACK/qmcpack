# Change Log

Notable changes to QMCPACK will be documented in this file.

## [3.5.0] - 2018-08-02

### Notes

This release includes support for the latest Quantum Espresso version 6.3,
an initial implementation of periodic Gaussian support via PySCF, and a new
version of the hybrid or "APW" representation of orbitals. Many minor
bugs have been fixed, configuration and documentation improved. 

Note that the PDF manuals are no longer included with the source. Versions
are available online via https://qmcpack.org . The PDFs can be built
using manual/build_manual.sh and
nexus/documentation/user_guide_source/build_nexus_user_guide.sh

Attention developers: This version contains substantially fewer source
lines than previous versions due to clean out of old code and unused
execution paths. Refactoring to improve the internal structure of
QMCPACK is ongoing. Track the develop branch and follow discussion on
GitHub closely to avoid difficult merges.

* Support for Quantum Espresso 6.3 and 6.2.1. Check documentation to
  ensure compiled with required HDF5 support.
* Support for periodic gaussians and PySCF generated
  wavefunctions. Initial version is limited to Gamma-point.
* Improved hybrid representation of single particle orbitals
  (APW-like) for significantly reduced memory usage and possible
  accuracy increase compared to conventional spline representation. https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07406
* Norms of orbitals are checked inside QMCPACK to catch conversion errors.
* Added verbosity setting to QMCPACK output.
* CUDA can now be enabled with SoA builds.
* Many improvements to QMCPACK manual, including all new features, CIPSI, 3-body
  jastrow factor description, spack package, and enabling HTML generation.
* CMake configuration improvements, particularly around MKL handling.
* Extensive cleanup of unused source files and unused code paths
  removed, reducing the number of source lines by over 30 percent.

### Known bugs

* Weight of first block of DMC density is incorrect in CPU
  code. DMC densities in CUDA GPU code are incorrect for all
  blocks. [\#934](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/issues/934) and [\#925](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/issues/925)
* Runs with only a single electron may crash. [\#945](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/issues/945)

### NEXUS

* Added script to build NEXUS user guide.
* Various bugfixes including to GAMESS input parsing.

## [3.4.0] - 2018-01-29

### Notes

This release includes size-consistent t-moves, and improvements to
load balancing and memory usage that will be visible in large
runs. Significant revisions have been made to the gaussian
wavefunction reader and a PySCF interface is in progress.  A bug
affecting non-git installs (from release tarballs) is fixed. Feedback
is particularly welcome on the new features.

* Size consistent t-moves implemented (Casula 2010 algorithm).
  Enabled via nonlocalmoves parameter, see manual.
* Bugfix: For non-git builds, build process failed on some systems
  due to git-rev.h handling.
* Optimized load balancing in DMC. Command line option async_swap
  removed. Parameter use_nonblocking now disables non-blocking MPI
  load balancing. Non-blocking MPI is now enabled by default.
* Improved memory handling and usage in SoA code, increases
  performance.  
* Improved stability of GPU matrix inversion for large runs.
* Ongoing improvements to output to improve readability.
* Initial interface to PySCF for real space QMC trial wavefunctions.
* Enabled use of HDF5 files for Gaussian based wavefunctions
  with SoA implementation.
* Added Appendix to manual listing all known QMCPACK publications.
  This will be updated on an ongoing basis. Please advise of any
  missing publications.
* Optimized momentum distribution estimator. Supported by SoA and
  1,2,3-body Jastrow functions.
* Support for labeled timers in Intel VTune based profiling.

### NEXUS

* Minor bugfixes and improvements.

### Known limitations

* PySCF interface is preliminary. convert4qmc is updated, but manual
  entries are not yet provided. This will be improved in later
  versions. The interface is currently only for isolated molecular
  systems. A full periodic implementation is in progress.

* Documentation, examples and tutorials are not yet consistent with
  the updated converter convert4qmc.

## [3.3.0] - 2017-12-18

### Notes

This release includes new methods, converter updates, and many
optimizations, feature improvements, and bug fixes. It is a
recommended update for all users.

### QMCPACK updates

* Support for finite difference linear response (FDLR) method and
  wavefunctions, developed and contributed by Nick Blunt and Eric
  Neuscamman, see Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 194101 (2017),
  https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4998197 and
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09439 .
* Major update to convert4qmc, conversion from GAMESS and other
  gaussian basis set codes. HDF5 output is now supported for large
  wavefunctions with -hdf5 option. Significantly improved example
  inputs \*.qmc.in.xml.
* Gaussian based trial wavefunctions now supported by structure of
  arrays implementation (ENABLE_SOA=1). A full reimplementation that
  will also support gaussians in periodic boundary conditions, e.g.
  from pyscf, is in progress.
* Initialization of multideterminant wavefunctions improved for faster
  startup and lower memory usage. In practice this significantly
  raises the usable maximum number of determinants.
* Maximum CPU time setting (maxcpusecs): QMC drivers will not
  start a new block if there is not enough estimated time remaining to
  complete the next block and gracefully shut down.
* Homogeneous electron gas wavefunction support and tests.
* New command line verbosity command line flag -verbosity. Output of
  QMCPACK will be overhauled over the next few releases to
  support low, high, and debug options, and also to significantly improve
  readability and utility.
* Bugfix: Umrigar drift diffusion term is now consistent with the
  Umrigar small time step error algorithm with complex wavefunctions.
* Bugfix: Momentum distribution is now correctly weighted and also
  correctly signed for twist averaging.
* Renamed performance tests with atom and electron count.
* Removed support for "buffering" of non-local pseudopotential
  wavefunction components during optimization (useBuffer setting) to
  reduce memory usage and for simplicity.
* doxygen documentation for developer-level documentation of the code
  and file structure. Produced via make in qmcpack/doxygen. HTML
  currently published at http://docs.qmcpack.org/doxygen/doxy/
* Many minor bug fixes and improved tests.

### NEXUS

* Improved postprocessing support for Quantum Espresso.
* Various minor bug fixes.

### Known issues and limitations

* Documentation, examples and tutorials are not yet consistent with
 the updated converter convert4qmc.
* Core functionality is largely compatible with ENABLE_SOA but
  some specialized wavefunctions and observables are not.
* Use of GNU compilers with glibc 2.23 builds will crash due to a bug
  in libmvec of glibc. The glibc version can be verified by
  "ldd --version".

## [3.2.0] - 2017-09-21

### Notes

many calculations. A C++11 compiler is now required. It is a
recommended update.

### QMCPACK updates

* Major speedup for calculations using spline wavefunctions via
  initial implementation of "Structure of Arrays" data layout and
  improved algorithms. Enabled via -DENABLE_SOA=1. Benefits all CPU
  architectures. Many runs are doubled in speed. Not yet available for
  Gaussian-basis sets or for all observables and QMC methods. See
  writeup in manual for guidance.
* A compiler supporting C++11 is now required.
* DMC respects MaxCPUSecs parameter and will gracefully shut down and
  not start a new block if there is not sufficient estimated time to
  complete it.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-01-30

### Notes

We are adopting [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) with this
release. It is the first to be made from the git repository on GitHub,
and the first named release since 2016-06-02 and subversion
revision 6964.
