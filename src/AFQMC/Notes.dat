-- Keeping H1 in host memory in HamOps and Propagator

-- make sure you can initialize arrays (by copy or move) from arrays using different allocators.
   Then you can decide to initialize arrays in host memory in factories and the constructor
   takes care of initializing the object's array in the appropriate memory space during construction!

-- when more of the cuda code is complete, guard cpu only code with ifndef ENABLE_CUDA


-- right now the use of csr_matrix in cuda code is unsafe and generally difficult.
   To solve this, make a new csr_matrix-like class that looks like csr_matrix but that doesn't
   allow mutation/modification. This allows you to store things like nnz directly, since this class
   can't add/remove elements. Then pass nnz through the dispatching of csrmm and csrmv. This class 
   is memory owning. 


-- new strategy for observables
1. Let the estimator do all the implementation of walker averaged properties, 
   because there seems to be no way to make use of the PHMSD compact representation of references.
2. The BP class will generate the new green functions (from wset and Refs) and will calculate all desired
   properties based on them. The wave-function still provides the mapping from G to property, e.g. for EKT.
