# Einspline

Some of the files included in this QMCPACK einspline directory are based on the einspline library
released by Ken Esler http://einspline.sourceforge.net/ . einspline is a C library for the creation
and evaluation of interpolating cubic basis splines (B-splines) in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.

On 2018-02-20 the original einspline library was released under the BSD-3-clause license
( https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause ), as noted at
https://sourceforge.net/p/einspline/code/443/ .
