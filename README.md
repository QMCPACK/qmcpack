QMCPACK is an open-source production-level many-body ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo code for computing the electronic structure of
atoms, molecules, 2D nanomaterials and solids. The solid-state capabilities include metallic systems as well as insulators.
QMCPACK is expected to run well on workstations through to the latest generation supercomputers. Besides high performance,
particular emphasis is placed on code quality and reproducibility.

# Obtaining and installing QMCPACK

 Obtain the latest release from https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/releases or clone the development source from
 https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack. A full installation guide and steps to perform an initial QMC calculation are given in the
 [extensive online documentation for QMCPACK](https://qmcpack.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html).

# Prerequisites

 * C++ 17 and C99 capable compilers. 
 * CMake v3.15.0 or later, build utility, http://www.cmake.org
 * BLAS/LAPACK, numerical library. Use vendor and platform-optimized libraries.
 * LibXml2, XML parser, http://xmlsoft.org/
 * HDF5, portable I/O library, http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
 * BOOST v1.61.0 or newer, peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries, http://www.boost.org
 * FFTW, FFT library, http://www.fftw.org/
 * MPI, parallel library. Optional, but a near requirement for production calculations.
 * Python3. Older versions are not supported as of January 2020.
 * CUDA v11.0 or later. Optional, but required for builds with NVIDIA GPU support.

We aim to support open source compilers and libraries released within two years of each QMCPACK release. Use of software versions
over two years old may work but is discouraged and untested. Proprietary compilers (Intel, NVHPC) are generally supported over the
same period but may require use of an exact version. We also aim to support the standard software environments on machines such as
Summit at OLCF, Theta at ALCF, and Cori at NERSC. Use of the most recently released compilers and library versions is particularly
encouraged for highest performance and easiest configuration.

Nightly testing currently includes the following software versions on x86:

* Compilers
  * GCC 11.2.0, 9.2.0
  * Clang/LLVM 13.0.0
  * Intel 19.1.1.217 configured to use C++ library from GCC 9.1.0 
  * NVIDIA HPC SDK 21.5 configured to use C++ library from GCC 9.1.0
* Boost 1.77.0, 1.68.0
* HDF5 1.12.1
* FFTW 3.3.10, 3.3.8
* CMake 3.21.1, 3.15.0
* MPI
  * OpenMPI 4.1.1, 3.1.6
  * Intel MPI 19.1.1.217
* CUDA 11.4

Workflow tests are performed with Quantum Espresso v6.8.0 and PySCF v1.7.5. These check trial wavefunction generation and
conversion through to actual QMC runs.

On a developmental basis we also check the latest Clang and GCC development versions, AMD AOMP and Intel OneAPI compilers.

# Building with CMake

 The build system for QMCPACK is based on CMake.  It will auto-configure based on the detected compilers and libraries. Previously
 QMCPACK made extensive use of toolchains, but the system has since been updated to eliminate the use of toolchain files for most
 cases.  Specific compile options can be specified either through specific environment or CMake variables.  When the libraries are
 installed in standard locations, e.g., /usr, /usr/local, there is no need to set environment or CMake variables for the packages.

 See the manual linked at https://qmcpack.readthedocs.io/en/develop/ and https://www.qmcpack.org/documentation or buildable using
 sphinx from the sources in docs/. A PDF version is still available at https://qmcpack.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/develop/pdf/

## Quick build

 If you are feeling lucky and are on a standard UNIX-like system such
 as a Linux workstation:

 * Safest quick build option is to specify the C and C++ compilers
   through their MPI wrappers. Here we use Intel MPI and Intel
   compilers. Move to the build directory, run CMake and make
```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpiicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpiicpc ..
make -j 8
```

 * Substitute mpicc and mpicxx or other wrapped compiler names to suit
   your system. e.g. With OpenMPI use
```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx ..
make -j 8
```

* If you are feeling particularly lucky, you can skip the compiler
   specification:
```
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 8
```

 The complexities of modern computer hardware and software systems are
 such that you should check that the auto-configuration system has made
 good choices and picked optimized libraries and compiler settings
 before doing significant production. i.e. Check the details below.

## Set the environment

 A number of environment variables affect the build.  In particular,
 they can control the default paths for libraries, the default
 compilers, etc. The list of environment variables is given below:

| Environment variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
|   CXX          |    C++ compiler |
|   CC           |    C Compiler |
|   MKL_ROOT     |    Path for MKL |
|   HDF5_ROOT    |    Path for HDF5 |
|   BOOST_ROOT   |    Path for Boost |
|   FFTW_HOME    |    Path for FFTW |

## CMake options

 In addition to reading the environment variables, CMake provides a
 number of optional variables that can be set to control the build and
 configure steps.  When passed to CMake, these variables will take
 precedent over the environment and default variables.  To set them
 add -D FLAG=VALUE to the configure line between the CMake command and
 the path to the source directory.

 * General build options

```
    CMAKE_C_COMPILER    Set the C compiler
    CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER  Set the C++ compiler
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE    A variable which controls the type of build (defaults to Release).
                        Possible values are:
                        None (Do not set debug/optmize flags, use CMAKE_C_FLAGS or CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS)
                        Debug (create a debug build)
                        Release (create a release/optimized build)
                        RelWithDebInfo (create a release/optimized build with debug info)
                        MinSizeRel (create an executable optimized for size)
    CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME   Set value to CrayLinuxEnvironment when cross-compiling
                        in Cray Programming Environment.
    CMAKE_C_FLAGS       Set the C flags.  Note: to prevent default debug/release flags
                        from being used, set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None
                        Also supported: CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG, CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE,
                                        CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS     Set the C++ flags.  Note: to prevent default debug/release flags
                        from being used, set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None
                        Also supported: CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG, CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE,
                                        CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO
```

 * Key QMC build options

```
     QMC_CUDA            Enable legacy CUDA code path for NVIDIA GPU acceleration (1:yes, 0:no)
     QMC_COMPLEX         Build the complex (general twist/k-point) version (1:yes, 0:no)
     QMC_MIXED_PRECISION Build the mixed precision (mixing double/float) version
                         (1:yes (GPU default), 0:no (CPU default)).
                         The CPU support is experimental.
                         Use float and double for base and full precision.
                         The GPU support is quite mature.
                         Use always double for host side base and full precision
                         and use float and double for CUDA base and full precision.
     ENABLE_CUDA         ON/OFF(default). Enable CUDA code path for NVIDIA GPU acceleration.
                         Production quality for AFQMC. Pre-production quality for real-space.
                         Use CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES, default 70, to set the actual GPU architecture.
     ENABLE_OFFLOAD      ON/OFF(default). Experimental feature. Enable OpenMP target offload for GPU acceleration.
     ENABLE_TIMERS       ON(default)/OFF. Enable fine-grained timers. Timers are on by default but at level coarse
                         to avoid potential slowdown in tiny systems.
                         For systems beyond tiny sizes (100+ electrons) there is no risk.
```

 * Additional QMC options

```
     QE_BIN              Location of Quantum Espresso binaries including pw2qmcpack.x
     RMG_BIN             Location of RMG binary
     QMC_DATA            Specify data directory for QMCPACK performance and integration tests
     QMC_INCLUDE         Add extra include paths
     QMC_EXTRA_LIBS      Add extra link libraries
     QMC_BUILD_STATIC    ON/OFF(default). Add -static flags to build
     QMC_SYMLINK_TEST_FILES Set to zero to require test files to be copied. Avoids space
                            saving default use of symbolic links for test files. Useful
                            if the build is on a separate filesystem from the source, as
                            required on some HPC systems.
```

  * libxml2 related

```
     LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR Include directory for libxml2
     LIBXML2_LIBRARY     Libxml2 library
```

* HDF5 related
```
     HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL 1(default for MPI build)/0, enables/disable parallel HDF5 library searching.
     ENABLE_PHDF5         1(default for parallel HDF5 library)/0, enables/disable parallel collective I/O.

```

  * FFTW related
```
     FFTW_INCLUDE_DIRS   Specify include directories for FFTW
     FFTW_LIBRARY_DIRS   Specify library directories for FFTW
```

## Example configure and build

In the build directory, run cmake with appropriate options, then
make.

* Using Intel compilers and their MPI wrappers. Assumes HDF5 and
libxml2 will be automatically detected.

```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpiicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpiicpc ..
make -j 8
```

##  Special notes

It is recommended to create a helper script that contains the
configure line for CMake.  This is particularly useful when using
environment variables, packages are installed in custom locations,
or the configure line may be long or complex.  In this case it is
recommended to add "rm -rf CMake*" before the configure line to remove
existing CMake configure files to ensure a fresh configure each time
that the script is called.  and example script build.sh is given
below:
```
export CXX=mpic++
export CC=mpicc
export HDF5_ROOT=/opt/hdf5
export BOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost

rm -rf CMake*

cmake                                               \
  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug                         \
  -D LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/libxml2      \
  -D LIBXML2_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so \
  -D FFTW_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include                 \
  -D FFTW_LIBRARY_DIRS=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu    \
  -D QMC_DATA=/projects/QMCPACK/qmc-data            \
  ..
```

##  Additional examples:

Set compile flags manually:
```
   cmake                                                \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None                          \
      -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc                         \
      -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpic++                      \
      -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="  -O3 -fopenmp -malign-double -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-limit=1000 -fstrict-aliasing -funroll-all-loops -Wno-deprecated -march=native -mtune=native" \
      -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -fopenmp -malign-double -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-limit=1000 -fstrict-aliasing -funroll-all-loops -Wno-deprecated -march=native -mtune=native" \
      ..
```

Add extra include directories:
```
   cmake                                                \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                       \
      -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc                         \
      -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpic++                      \
      -D QMC_INCLUDE="~/path1;~/path2"                  \
      ..
```

# Testing and validation of QMCPACK

We highly encourage tests to be run before using QMCPACK. Details are given in the [QMCPACK
manual](https://qmcpack.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html). QMCPACK includes extensive validation tests to ensure the
correctness of the code, compilers, tools, and runtime. The tests should ideally be run each compilation, and certainly before any
research use. The tests include checks of the output against known mean-field, quantum chemistry, and other QMC results.

While some tests are fully deterministic, due to QMCPACK's stochastic nature some tests are statistical and can occasionally fail.
We employ a range of test names and labeling to differentiate between these, as well as developmental tests that are known to
fail. In particular, "deterministic" tests include this in their ctest test name, while tests known to be unstable (stochastically
or otherwise) are labeled unstable using ctest labels.

The tests currently use up to 16 cores in various combinations of MPI tasks and OpenMP threads. Current status for many
combinations of systems, compilers, and libraries can be checked at https://cdash.qmcpack.org

Note that due to the small electron and walker counts used in the tests, they should not be used for any performance measurements.
These should be made on problem sizes that are representative of actual research calculations. As described in the manual,
performance tests are provided to aid in monitoring performance.

## Run the unit tests

From the build directory, invoke ctest specifying only the unit tests
```
ctest -R unit
```
All of these tests should pass.

## Run the deterministic tests

From the build directory, invoke ctest specifying only tests
that are deterministic and known to be reliable.
```
ctest -R deterministic -LE unstable
```

These tests currently take a few seconds to run, and include all the unit tests. All tests should pass. Failing tests likely
indicate a significant problem that should be solved before using QMCPACK further. This ctest invocation can be used as part of an
automated installation verification process.
 
## Run the short (quick) tests

 From the build directory, invoke ctest specifying only tests
 including "short" to run that are known to be stable.
```
ctest -R short -LE unstable
```

 These tests currently take up to around one hour. On average, all
 tests should pass at a three sigma level of reliability. Any
 initially failing test should pass when rerun.

## Run individual tests

Individual tests can be run by specifying their name
```
ctest -R name-of-test-to-run
```
