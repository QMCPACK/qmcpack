\section intro_sec Summary

QMCPACK, an open-source QMC simulation code written in C++, implements advanced
QMC algorithms for large-scale parallel computers. Designed with the modularity
afforded by object-oriented architecture, it makes extensive use of template
metaprogramming to achieve high computational efficiency through inlined
specializations. It utilizes a hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach to parallelization to
take advantage of the growing number of cores per SMP node. Finally, it
utilizes standard file formats for input and output, including XML and HDF5, to
facilitate data exchange.

QMCPACK development at the Materials Computation Center was supported by the
National Science Foundation under grant no. DMR-03 25939 ITR, with additional
support through the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory (U.S. Dept.
of Energy grant no.  DEFG02-91ER45439) at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign and National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

Currently, the principal authors are funded by
- PetaApps, supported by the U. S. National Science Foundation
- ORNL LDRD

We also acknowledge the NCCS for help and support in accessing their resources,
as part of a DOE INCITE allocation grant supported by US Department of Energy
and  NCSA, TACC and NICS for providing resources as a part of NSF TeraGrid
allocation grant

Main contributing authors are Jeongnim Kim  and  the members of the electron
structure group of Profs. Ceperley and Martin at University of Illinois. 
 
Different parts of the code are written by different people, whose names are
usually signed at the top of each file.  If you are interested in participating
