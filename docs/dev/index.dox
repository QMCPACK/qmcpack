/*!  \mainpage Developers' guides   
QMCPACK is written in C++ and proficiency in C++ is required. Currently, C++03
standard is adopted and the transition to C++11 will start after the code
freeze at the end of 2013. MPI, OpenMP and CUDA are used for parallelizations.

The most recent released version is available at
https://www.qmcpack.org under UIUC/NCSA open-source licence. Those who
are interested in QMCPACK development are strongly encouraged to
contact the developers to establish collaborations so that one can
access to the developers' svn respository. This is exactly the same as
the release version except for being (i) slightly more recent, (ii) having fewer bugs due to bugfixes, and (iii) potentially having new bugs due to new features.
Although it is not required, the developers will appreciate if any new
software can be made available to others when the research and development
is published.  The developers and users will comply with the
constraints posed by the contributors under the terms of the licence.

These tools are used in QMCPACK development and familiarity with them will be helpful in working with QMCPACK.
- Compilers : GNU, Intel and IBM compilers are tested and supported. There
  is no plan to support other compilers. 
- subversion : revision system
- cmake : 2.8 and later, build system
- doxygen : 1.8, code documentation and the guides (including this.)
