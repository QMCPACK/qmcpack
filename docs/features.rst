Features of QMCPACK
===================

Note that besides direct use, most features are also available via Nexus, an advanced workflow tool to automate all aspects of QMC
calculation from initial DFT calculations through to final analysis. Use of Nexus is highly recommended for research calculations
due to the greater ease of use and increased reproducibility.

Real-space Monte Carlo
----------------------

The following list contains the main production-level features of QMCPACK for real-space Monte Carlo. If you do not see a specific
feature that you are interested in, check the remainder of this manual or ask if that specific feature can be made available.

-  Variational Monte Carlo (VMC).

-  Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC).

-  Reptation Monte Carlo.

-  Single and multideterminant Slater Jastrow wavefunctions.

-  Wavefunction updates using optimized multideterminant algorithm of
   Clark et al.

-  Backflow wavefunctions.

-  One, two, and three-body Jastrow factors.

-  Excited state calculations via flexible occupancy assignment of
   Slater determinants.

-  All electron and nonlocal pseudopotential calculations.

-  Casula T-moves for variational evaluation of nonlocal
   pseudopotentials (non-size-consistent and size-consistent variants).

-  Spin-orbit coupling from relativistic pseudopotentials following the 
   approach of Melton, Bennett, and Mitas.

-  Support for twist boundary conditions and calculations on metals.

-  Wavefunction optimization using the “linear method” of Umrigar and
   coworkers, with an arbitrary mix of variance and energy in the objective
   function.

-  Blocked, low memory adaptive shift optimizer of Zhao and Neuscamman.

-  Gaussian, Slater, plane-wave, and real-space spline basis sets for
   orbitals.

-  Interface and conversion utilities for plane-wave wavefunctions from
   Quantum ESPRESSO (Plane-Wave Self-Consistent Field package [PWSCF]).

-  Interface and conversion utilities for Gaussian-basis wavefunctions
   from GAMESS, PySCF, and QP2. Many more are supported via the molden format and molden2qmc.

-  Easy extension and interfacing to other electronic structure codes
   via standardized XML and HDF5 inputs.

-  MPI parallelism, with scaling to millions of cores.

-  Fully threaded using OpenMP.

-  Highly efficient vectorized CPU code tailored for modern architectures. :cite:`IPCC_SC17`

-  OpenMP-offload-based performance portable GPU implementation, see :ref:`gpufeatures`.

-  Legacy GPU (NVIDIA CUDA) implementation (limited functionality - see :ref:`gpufeatures`).

-  Analysis tools for minimal environments (Perl only) through to
   Python-based environments with graphs produced via matplotlib (included with Nexus).

Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo
-----------------------------------

The orbital-space Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method is now also available in QMCPACK. The main input data are the
matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in a given single particle basis set, which must be produced from mean-field calculations such
as Hartree-Fock or density functional theory. A partial list of the current capabilities of the code follows. For a detailed
description of the available features, see  :ref:`afqmc`.

-  Phaseless AFQMC algorithm of Zhang et al. :cite:`PhysRevLett.90.136401`.

-  Very efficient GPU implementation for most features. 

-  “Hybrid" and “local energy" propagation schemes.

-  Hamiltonian matrix elements from (1) Molpro’s FCIDUMP format (which
   can be produced by Molpro, PySCF, and VASP) and (2) internal HDF5
   format produced by PySCF (see AFQMC section below).

-  AFQMC calculations with RHF (closed-shell doubly occupied), ROHF
   (open-shell doubly occupied), and UHF (spin polarized broken
   symmetry) symmetry.

-  Single and multideterminant trial wavefunctions. Multideterminant
   expansions with either orthogonal or nonorthogonal determinants.

-  Fast update scheme for orthogonal multideterminant expansions.

-  Distributed propagation algorithms for large systems. Enables
   calculations where data structures do not fit on a single node.

-  Complex implementation for PBC calculations with complex integrals.

-  Sparse representation of large matrices for reduced memory usage.

-  Mixed and back-propagated estimators.

-  Specialized implementation for solids with k-point symmetry (e.g.
   primitive unit cells with k-points).


.. _gpufeatures:

Supported GPU features for real space QMC
-----------------------------------------

There are two GPU implementations in the code base.

  - **Performance portable implementation** (recommended). Implements real space QMC methods
    using OpenMP offload programming model and accelerated linear algebra libraries.
    Runs with good performance on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and the Intel GPU support is under development.
    Unlike the "legacy" implementation, it is feature complete
    and users may mix and match CPU-only and GPU-accelerated features.

  - **Legacy implementation**. Fully based on NVIDIA CUDA. Achieves very good speedup on NVIDIA GPUs.
    However, only a very limited subset of features is available.


QMCPACK supports running on multi-GPU node architectures via MPI.

Additional information:

- Performance portable implementation requires using batched QMC drivers.

- Legacy CUDA implementation only supports T-move v0 or no T-move.

- In most features, the algorithmic and implementation details differ a lot between these two GPU implementations.

Sharing of spline data across multiple GPUs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharing of GPU spline data enables distribution of the data across
multiple GPUs on a given computational node. For example, on a
two-GPU-per-node system, each GPU would have half of the orbitals. This
allows use of larger overall spline tables than would fit in the memory
of individual GPUs and potentially up to the total GPU memory on a node.
To obtain high performance, large electron counts or a high-performing
CPU-GPU interconnect is required.
This feature is only supported in the legacy implementation.

To use this feature, the following needs to be done:

-  The CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS) needs to be used (e.g., on OLCF
   Summit/SummitDev use “-alloc_flags gpumps" for bsub). If MPI is not
   detected, sharing will be disabled.

-  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES needs to be properly set to control each rank’s
   visible CUDA devices (e.g., on OLCF Summit/SummitDev create a
   resource set containing all GPUs with the respective number of ranks
   with “jsrun –task-per-rs Ngpus -g Ngpus").

-  In the determinant set definition of the <wavefunction> section, the
   “gpusharing" parameter needs to be set (i.e., <determinantset
   gpusharing=“yes">). See
   :ref:`spo-spline`.
