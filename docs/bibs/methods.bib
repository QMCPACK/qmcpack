The remarkable feature of this approach is that, in principle, several resonating valence bonds can be dealt simultaneously with a single determinant, at a computational cost growing with the number of electrons similar to more conventional methods, such as Hartree-Fock or density functional theory. Moreover we describe an extension of the stochastic reconfiguration method, which was recently introduced for the energy minimization of simple atomic wave functions. Within this extension the atomic positions can be considered as further variational parameters, which can be optimized together with the remaining ones. The method is applied to several molecules from Li2 to benzene by obtaining total energies, bond lengths and binding energies comparable with much more demanding multiconfiguration schemes.}",

We first show that it is possible to obtain a very good description of the C2 dimer and the benzene molecule by using pseudopotentials for the chemically inert 1s electrons and a resonating valence bond wave function as a variational ansatz, expanded on a relatively small Gaussian basis set. We employ an improved version of the stochastic reconfiguration technique to optimize the many-body wave function, which is the starting point for highly accurate simulations based on the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo method. This projection technique provides a rigorous variational upper bound for the total energy, even in the presence of pseudopotentials, and substantially improves the accuracy of the trial wave function, which already yields a large fraction of the dynamical and nondynamical electron correlation. We show that the energy dispersion of two benzene molecules in the parallel displaced geometry is significantly deeper than the face-to-face configuration. However, contrary to previous studies based on post-Hartree-Fock methods, the binding energy remains weak (≃2kcal∕mol) also in this geometry, and its value is in agreement with the most accurate and recent experimental findings [H. Krause et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 184, 411 (1991)].}",
