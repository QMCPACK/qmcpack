<span id="id1"></span><h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>QMCPACK is an open-source, high-performance electronic structure code
that implements numerous Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. Its main
applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular,
periodic 2D, and periodic 3D solid-state systems. Variational Monte
Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), and a number of other advanced
QMC algorithms are implemented. By directly solving the Schrodinger
equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as
density functional theory but at a trade-off of much greater
computational expense. Distinct from many other correlated many-body
methods, QMC methods are readily applicable to both bulk (periodic) and
isolated molecular systems.</p>
<p>QMCPACK is written in C++ and is designed with the modularity afforded
by object-oriented programming. It makes extensive use of template
metaprogramming to achieve high computational efficiency. Because of the
modular architecture, the addition of new wavefunctions, algorithms, and
observables is relatively straightforward. For parallelization, QMCPACK
uses a fully hybrid (OpenMP,CUDA)/MPI approach to optimize memory usage
and to take advantage of the growing number of cores per SMP node or
graphical processing units (GPUs) and accelerators. High parallel and
computational efficiencies are achievable on the largest supercomputers.
Finally, QMCPACK uses standard file formats for input and output in XML
and HDF5 to facilitate data exchange.</p>
<p>This manual currently serves as an introduction to the essential
features of QMCPACK and as a guide to installing and running it. Over
time this manual will be expanded to include a fuller introduction to
QMC methods in general and to include more of the specialized features
in QMCPACK.</p>
<div class="section" id="quickstart-and-a-first-qmcpack-calculation">
<h2>Quickstart and a first QMCPACK calculation<a class="headerlink" href="#quickstart-and-a-first-qmcpack-calculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In case you are keen to get started, this section describes how to
quickly build and run QMCPACK on a standard UNIX or Linux-like system.
The autoconfiguring build system usually works without much fuss on
these systems. If C++, MPI, BLAS/LAPACK, FFTW, HDF5, and CMake are
already installed, QMCPACK can be built and run within five minutes. For
supercomputers, cross-compilation systems, and other computer clusters,
the build system might require hints on the locations of libraries and
which versions to use, typical of any code; see
<a class="reference internal" href="installation.html#obtaininginstalling"><span class="std std-ref">Obtaining, installing, and validating QMCPACK</span></a>.
<span class="xref std std-ref">installexamples</span> includes
complete examples of installations for common workstations and
supercomputers that you can reuse.</p>
<p>To build QMCPACK:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Download the latest QMCPACK distribution from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.qmcpack.org">http://www.qmcpack.org</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Untar the archive (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tar</span> <span class="pre">xvf</span> <span class="pre">qmcpack_v1.3.tar.gz</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Check the instructions in the README file.</p></li>
<li><p>Run CMake in a suitable build directory to configure QMCPACK for your
system: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">qmcpack/build;</span> <span class="pre">cmake</span> <span class="pre">..</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>If CMake is unable to find all needed libraries, see
<a class="reference internal" href="installation.html#obtaininginstalling"><span class="std std-ref">Obtaining, installing, and validating QMCPACK</span></a> for
instructions and specific build instructions for common systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Build QMCPACK: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">-j</span> <span class="pre">16</span></code>; use the latter for a faster parallel build on a
system using, for example, 16 processes.</p></li>
<li><p>The QMCPACK executable is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin/qmcpack</span></code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>QMCPACK is distributed with examples illustrating different
capabilities. Most of the examples are designed to run quickly with
modest resources. We’ll run a short diffusion Monte Carlo calculation of
a water molecule:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Go to the appropriate example directory: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">../examples/molecules/H2O.</span></code></p></li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(Optional) Put the QMCPACK binary on your path: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">export</span> <span class="pre">PATH=\$PATH:location-of-qmcpack/build/bin</span></code></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Run QMCPACK: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">../../../build/bin/qmcpack</span> <span class="pre">simple-H2O.xml</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qmcpack</span> <span class="pre">simple-H2O.xml</span></code> if you followed the step above.</p></li>
<li><p>The run will output to the screen and generate a number of files:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ls H2O*
H2O.HF.wfs.xml      H2O.s001.scalar.dat H2O.s002.cont.xml
H2O.s002.qmc.xml    H2O.s002.stat.h5    H2O.s001.qmc.xml
H2O.s001.stat.h5    H2O.s002.dmc.dat    H2O.s002.scalar.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Partially summarized results are in the standard text files with the
suffixes scalar.dat and dmc.dat. They are viewable with any standard
editor.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have Python and matplotlib installed, you can use the analysis
utility to produce statistics and plots of the data. See
<span class="xref std std-ref">analyzing</span> for information on
analyzing QMCPACK data.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export PATH=$PATH:location-of-qmcpack/nexus/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:location-of-qmcpack/nexus/library
qmca H2O.s002.scalar.dat         # For statistical analysis of the DMC data
qmca -t -q e H2O.s002.scalar.dat # Graphical plot of DMC energy
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The last command will produce a graph as per
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig1"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a>. This
shows the average energy of the DMC walkers at each timestep. In a real
simulation we would have to check equilibration, convergence with walker
population, time step, etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="performance">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>QMCPACK implements modern Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, is highly
parallel, and is written using very efficient code for high per-CPU or
on-node performance. In particular, the code is highly vectorizable,
giving high performance on modern central processing units (CPUs) and
GPUs. We believe QMCPACK delivers performance either comparable to or
better than other QMC codes when similar calculations are run,
particularly for the most common QMC methods and for large systems. If
you find a calculation where this is not the case, or you simply find
performance slower than expected, please post on the Google group or
contact one of the developers. These reports are valuable. If your
calculation is sufficiently mainstream we will optimize QMCPACK to
improve the performance.</p>

<p>QMCPACK is fully open source, and we welcome contributions. If you are
planning a development, early discussions are encouraged. Please post on
the QMCPACK Google group or contact the developers. We can tell you
whether anyone else is working on a similar feature or whether any
related work has been done in the past. Credit for your contribution can
be obtained, for example, through citation of a paper or by becoming one
of the authors on the next version of the standard QMCPACK reference
citation.</p>
<p>A guide to developing for QMCPACK, including instructions on how to work
with GitHub and make pull requests (contributions) to the main source
are listed on the QMCPACK GitHub wiki:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/wiki">https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Contributions are made under the same license as QMCPACK, the UIUC/NCSA
open source license. If this is problematic, please discuss with a
developer.</p>
<p>Please note the following guidelines for contributions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Additions should be fully synchronized with the latest release
version and ideally the latest develop branch on github. Merging of
code developed on older versions is error prone.</p></li>
<li><p>Code should be cleanly formatted, commented, portable, and accessible
to other programmers. That is, if you need to use any clever tricks,
add a comment to note this, why the trick is needed, how it works,
etc. Although we like high performance, ease of maintenance and
accessibility are also considerations.</p></li>
<li><p>Comment your code. You are not only writing it for the compiler for
also for other humans! (We know this is a repeat of the previous
point, but it is important enough to repeat.)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a brief description of the method, algorithms, and inputs and
outputs suitable for inclusion in this manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop some short tests that exercise the functionality that can be
used for validation and for examples. We can help with this and their
integration into the test system.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="qmcpack-roadmap">
<span id="roadmap"></span><h2>QMCPACK Roadmap<a class="headerlink" href="#qmcpack-roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A general outline of the QMCPACK roadmap is given in the following sections. Suggestions for improvements are welcome, particularly those
that would facilitate new scientific applications. For example, if an
interface to a particular quantum chemical or density functional code
would help, this would be given strong consideration.</p>
<div class="section" id="code">
<h3>Code<a class="headerlink" href="#code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will continue to improve the accessibility and usability of QMCPACK
through combinations of more convenient input parameters, improved
workflow, integration with more quantum chemical and density functional
codes, and a wider range of examples.</p>
<p>In terms of methodological development, we expect to significantly
increase the range of QMC algorithms in QMCPACK in the near future.</p>
<p>Computationally, we are porting QMCPACK to the next generation of
supercomputer systems. The internal changes required to run efficiently
on these systems are expected to benefit <em>all</em> platforms due to improved
vectorization, cache utilization, and memory performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h3>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This manual describes the core features of QMCPACK that are required for
routine research calculations, i.e., the VMC and DMC methods, how to
obtain and optimize trial wavefunctions, and simple observables. Over
time this manual will be expanded to include a broader introduction to
QMC methods and to describe more features of the code.</p>
<p>Because of its history as a research code, QMCPACK contains a variety of
additional QMC methods, trial wavefunction forms, potentials, etc.,
that, although not critical, might be very useful for specialized
calculations or particular material or chemical systems. These “secret
features” (every code has these) are not actually secret but simply lack
descriptions, example inputs, and tests. You are encouraged to browse
and read the source code to find them. New descriptions will be added
over time but can also be prioritized and added on request (e.g., if a
specialized Jastrow factor would help or a historical Jastrow form is
needed for benchmarking).
