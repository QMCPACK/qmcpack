Carbon molecules QMC Performance Benchmarks

1. Introduction

These benchmarks are VMC and DMC runs for carbon molecules
in order to measure LCAO performance for various system sizes.   
This is in contrast to the conventional integration tests where
the particle counts are too small to be representative.
Care is still needed to remove initialization, I/O, and compute
a representative performance measure.

See the explanation, discussion, and disclaimer in ../NiO/README for
general guidelines. If you are interested in setting up a new benchmark
or figure of merit, we encourage you to contact the developers.

The ctest integration is sufficient to run the benchmarks and measure
relative performance from version to version of QMCPACK and assess
proposed code changes. To obtain highest performance on a particular
platform, you will have to run the benchmarks in a standalone manner
and tune thread counts, placement, walker count (etc.)

2. Simulated system and QMC methods tested

The simulated systems are various sizes of a carbon ring (C12,C18,C24,
and C30) and C60 buckyball. All-electron tests (ae) using the cusp
correction and pseudopotential tests (pp) are included.

Name  Atoms Type  Electrons  Electrons per spin
 C12    12   AE       72         36
 C12    12   PP       48         24
 C18    18   AE      108         54
 C18    18   PP       72         36
 C24    24   AE      144         72
 C24    24   PP       96         48
 C30    30   AE      180         90
 C30    30   PP      120         60
 C60    60   PP      240        120

Runs consist of a number of short blocks of (i) VMC without drift (ii)
VMC with drift term included (iii) DMC with constant population.

Two sets of wavefunction are tested: LCAO with a one and
two body Jastrow functions, and a more complex form with an additional
three body Jastrow function. 

The tests require at least QMCPACK 3.6.0.

The above direct links were verified in July 2022 but may be fragile.

Only the specific problem sizes needed for the intended benchmarking runs need to be downloaded.

Please check the md5 value of h5 files before starting any
benchmarking.

The data files should be placed in a directory labeled C-molecule.
QMC_DATA should be set to the directory containing C-molecule
when CMake is run.
