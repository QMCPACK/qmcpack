NiO QMC Performance Benchmarks

1. Introduction

These benchmarks for VMC and DMC represent real research runs and are
large enough to be used for performance measurements. This is in
contrast to the conventional integration tests where the particle
counts are too small to be representative. Care is still needed to
remove initialization, I/O, and compute a representative performance
measure.

The ctest integration is sufficient to run the benchmarks and measure
relative performance from version to version of QMCPACK and assess
proposed code changes. To obtain highest performance on a particular
platform, you will have to run the benchmarks in a standalone manner
and tune thread counts, placement, walker count (etc.)

2. Simulated system and QMC methods tested

The simulated systems consist of a number of repeats of a NiO
primitive cell.

Name  Atoms Electrons  Electrons per spin
  S1     4       48             24
  S2     8       96             48
  S4    16      192             96
  S8    32      384            192
 S16    64      768            384
 S24    96     1152            576
 S32   128     1536            768
 S48   192     2304           1152
 S64   256     3072	      1536
S128   512     6144	      3072
S256  1024    12288	      6144

Runs consist of a number of short blocks of (i) VMC without drift (ii)
VMC with drift term included (iii) DMC with constant population.

These different runs vary the ratio between value, gradient, and
laplacian evaluations of the wavefunction. The most important
performance is for DMC, which dominates supercomputer time usage. For
a large enough supercell, the runs scale cubically in cost with the
number of "electrons per spin".

Two sets of wavefunction are tested: splined orbitals with a one and
two body Jastrow functions, and a more complex form with an additional
three body Jastrow function. The Jastrows are the same for each run
and are not reoptimized, as might be done for research.

On early 2017 era hardware and QMCPACK code, it is very likely that
only the first 3 supercells are easily runnable due to memory
limitations.

3. Requirements

The data files should be placed in a directory labeled NiO.

4. Throughput metric

A key result that can be extracted from the benchmarks is a throughput
metric, or the "time to move one walker", as measured on a per step
basis.  One can also compute the "walkers moved per second per node",
a throughput metric factoring the hardware availability (threads, cores, GPUs).

Higher throughput measures are better. Note however that the  metric
does not factor the equilibration period in the Monte Carlo or
consider the reasonable minimum and maximum number of walkers usable
for specific scientific calculation. Hence doubling the throughput
does not automatically halve the time to scientific solution, although
for many scenarios it will.

5. Benchmarking with ctest

This is the simplest way to calibrate performance though has some
limitations. The current choice is uses a fixed 1 MPI with 16 threads
on a single node on CPU systems. If you need to change either of these
numbers or you need to control more hardware behaviors such as thread
affinity, please read the next section.

To activate the ctest route, add the following option in your cmake
command line before building your binary:

-DQMC_DATA=YOUR_DATA_FOLDER

YOUR_DATA_FOLDER contains a folder called NiO with the h5 files in it.
Run tests with command "ctest -R performance-NiO" after building
QMCPACK. Add "-VV" to capture the QMCPACK output. Enabling the timers
is not essential, but activates fine grained timers and counters useful for
analysis such as the number of times specific kernels are called and
their speed.


6. Running the benchmarks manually

1) Complete step 5 (above), which will cause cmake to generate all
   input cases and adjust parameters.

2) Copy all the files in YOUR_BUILD_FOLDER/tests/performance/NiO
   (not YOUR_QMCPACK_REPO/tests/performance/NiO) to a work directory (WDIR)
   where you would like to run the benchmark.

3) Copy or softlink all the h5 files to your WDIR if the existing ones are broken.

4) Run benchmarks

   (i) On a standalone workstation

   Directly enter the dmc-xxx folders and run individual benchmarks.
   YOUR_BUILD_FOLDER/bin/qmcpack NiO-fcc-SX-dmc.xml

   (ii) On a cluster with a job queue sytem

   Prepare one job script for each dmc-xxx folder. We provide two samples for CPU
   (qmcpack-cpu-cetus.sub) and GPU (qmcpack-gpu-cooley.sub) runs at
   ALCF Cetus and Cooley to give you basic ideas how to run QMCPACK manually.
   
   a) Customize the header based on your machine.

   b) You always need to point the variable "exe" to the binary that
      you would like to benchmark.

   c) Update SXX in "file_prefix" based on the problem size to run.

   d) Customize the mpirun command based on the job dispatcher on your
      system and pick the number of MPI tasks and OMP threads as well
      as any other controls you would like to add.

   e) Submit your job.

5) Collect performance results

   One simple performance metric is the time per block which indicates
   how fast walkers are advancing. This metric can be measured with
   qmca, an analysis tool shipped with QMCPACK. Add
   YOUR_QMCPACK_REPO/nexus/bin to environment variable PATH.
   
   In your WDIR, use
   qmca -q bc -e 0 dmc*/*.scalar.dat to collect the timing for all the runs.

   Or in each subfolder, you type
   qmca -q bc -e 0 *.scalar.dat

   The current benchmarks contains 3 run sections:
   
     I) VMC + no drift
    II) VMC + drift
   III) DMC with constant population
   
   i.e. three timings are given per run. Timing information is also
   included in the standard output of QMCPACK and a *.info.xml produced
   by each run. In the standard output, "QMC Execution time" is the
   time per run section, e.g. all blocks of VMC with drift, while the
   fine grained timing information is printed at the end.

7. Additional considerations

When testing the mixed precision build, note that it performs more
computation than the full precision build to ensure numerical
accuracy.  One significant overhead is the recomputation of the
inverse of the Slater determinants at every block.  It can be diluted
by setting larger steps or substeps in the driver (VMC/DMC) block of
the XML input file or completely disabled by adding the following line
in each block.
<parameter name="blocks_between_recompute">0</parameter>

These settings will be revisited once performance data is obtained and
analyzed for a wide variety of platforms, with the goal of short but
representative runs.
