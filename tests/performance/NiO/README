NiO QMC Performance Benchmarks

1. Introduction

These benchmarks for VMC and DMC represent real research runs and are
large enough to be used for performance measurements. This is in
contrast to the conventional integration tests where the particle
counts are too small to be representative. Care is still needed to
remove initialization, I/O, and compute a representative performance
measure.

The ctest integration is sufficient to run the benchmarks and measure
relative performance from version to version of QMCPACK and assess
proposed code changes. To obtain highest performance on a particular
platform, you must run the benchmarks in a standalone manner and tune
thread counts, placement, walker count (etc.)

2. Simulated system and QMC methods tested

The simulated systems consist of a number of repeats of a NiO
primitive cell.

Name  Atoms Electrons  Electrons per spin
  S8    32      384            192
 S16    64      768            384
 S32   128     1536            768
 S64   256     3072	      1536
S128   512     6144	      3072
S256  1024    12288	      6144

Runs consist of a number of short blocks of (i) VMC without drift (ii)
VMC with drift term included (iii) DMC with constant population.

These different runs vary the ratio between value, gradient, and
laplacian evaluations of the wavefunction. The most important
performance is for DMC, which dominates supercomputer time usage. For
a large enough supercell, the runs scale cubically in cost with the
"electrons per spin".

Two sets of wavefunction are tested: splined orbitals with a one and
two body Jastrow functions, and a more complex form with an additional
three body Jastrow function. The Jastrows are the same for each run
and are not reoptimized, as might be done for research.

On early 2017 era hardware and QMCPACK code, it is very likely that
only the first 3 supercells are easily runnable due to memory
limitations.

3. Requirements

Download the necessary NiO h5 orbital files of different sizes from
the following link

https://anl.box.com/s/pveyyzrc2wuvg5tmxjzzwxeo561vh3r0

This link will be updated when a longer term storage host is
identified. You only need to download the sizes you would like to
include in your benchmarking runs.

Please check the md5 value of h5 files before starting any
benchmarking.

The data files should be placed in a directory labeled NiO.

4. Throughput metric

A key result that can be extracted from the benchmarks is a throughput
metric, or the "time to move one walker", as measured on a per step
basis.  One can also compute the "walkers moved per second per node",
a throughput metric factoring the hardware availability (threads, cores, GPUs).

Higher throughput measures are better. Note however that the  metric
does not factor the equilibration period in the Monte Carlo or
consider the reasonable minimum and maximum number of walkers usable
for specific scientific calculation. Hence doubling the throughput
does not automatically halve the time to scientific solution, although
for many scenarios it will.

5. Benchmarking with ctest

This is the simplest way to calibrate performance though has some
limitations.  The current choice is uses a fixed 1 MPI with 16 threads
on a single node on CPU systems. If you need to change either of these
numbers or you need to control more hardware behaviors such as thread
affinity, please read the next section.

To activate the ctest route, add the following option in your cmake
command line before building your binary:

-DQMC_DATA=YOUR_DATA_FOLDER -DENABLE_TIMERS=1

YOUR_DATA_FOLDER contains a folder called NiO with the h5 files in it.
Run tests with command "ctest -R performance-NiO" after building
QMCPACK. Add "-VV" to capture the QMCPACK output. Enabling the timers
is not essential, but activates fine grained timers and counters useful for
analysis such as the number of times specific kernels are called and
their speed.


6. Running the benchmarks manually

1) Copy the whole current folder (tests/performance/NiO) to a work
   directory (WDIR) you would like to run the benchmark. 
2) Copy or softlink all the h5 files to your WDIR.
3) Prepare an example job script for submitting a single calculation
   to a job queuing system. We provide two samples for CPU
   (qmcpack-cpu-cetus.sub) and GPU (qmcpack-gpu-cooley.sub) runs at
   ALCF Cetus and Cooley to give you basic ideas how to run QMCPACK manually.
   
   a) Customize the header based on your machine.
   b) You always need to point the variable "exe" to the binary that you would like to benchmark.
   c) "file_prefix" should not be changed and and the run script will
      update them by pointing to the right size. 
   d) Customize the mpirun based on the job dispatcher on your system
      and pick the MPI/THREADS as well as other controls you would like
      to add.

4) Customize scripts

   The files submit_cpu_cetus.sh and submit_gpu_cooley.sh are example
   scripts that provide a basic scan with a single run for each system
   size by submitting a series of jobs. We suggest making a customized
   versions for your benchmark machines.
   
   These scripts create individual folders for each benchmark run
   and submit it to the job queue.
   
   ATTENTION: the GPU run has a default 32 walkers per MPI rank. You may
   adjust it in the submit_gpu_cooley.sh based on your hardware capability.
   Generally, more walkers leads to higher performance.
   
   *If your system does not have a job queue, use "subjob=sh" in the script.

5) Collect performance results

   A simple performance metric can be the time per block which
   reflects how fast walkers are advancing.
   
   It can be measured with qmca, an analysis tool shipped with
   QMCPACK.
   
   In your WDIR, use
   qmca -q bc -e 0 dmc*/*.scalar.dat to collect the timing for all the runs.

   Or in each subfolder, you type
   qmca -q bc -e 0 *.scalar.dat

   The current benchmarks contains 3 run sections:
   
     I) VMC + no drift
    II) VMC + drift
   III) DMC with constant population
   
   So three timings are given per run.  Timing information is also
   included in the standard output of QMCPACK and a *.info.xml produced
   by each run. In the standard output, "QMC Execution time" is the
   time per run section, e.g. all blocks of VMC with drift, while the
   fine grained timing information is printed at the end.

7. Additional considerations

When testing the mixed precision build, note that it performs more
computation than the full precision build to ensure numerical
accuracy.  One significant overhead is the recomputation of the
inverse of the Slater determinants at every block.  It can be diluted
by setting larger steps or substeps in the driver (VMC/DMC) block of
the XML input file or completely disabled by adding the following line
in each block.
<parameter name="blocks_between_recompute">0</parameter>

These settings will be revisited once performance data is obtained and
analyzed for a wide variety of platforms, with the goal of short but
representative runs.
