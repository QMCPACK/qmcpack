These directories contain input files for the automated test
system. They are not intended to be run separately although any
QMCPACK inputs should run to completion when run from the same
directory as the input, e.g. mpirun -n 16 qmcpack vmc.in.xml

To run the automated tests, from the build directory, run

ctest -R short

for the short running tests. These take a few minutes to run on a 16
core machine. To run all tests simply run

ctest

Running all tests requires several hours due to strict statistics. You
can increase verbosity with "ctest -V".

The test definitions and configuration are in
src/tests/system/CMakeLists.txt
