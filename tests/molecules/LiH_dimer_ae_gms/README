Energy density test details
===========================
The tests include short/long VMC runs for a LiH dimer in open boundary 
conditions with the energy density estimator enabled, using a voronoi 
grid.  Reference data was generated using SVN revision 6259.

These tests check the correctness of Traces data streaming from the
evaluate_sp function in the following QMCPACK classes:

Kinetic, CoulombPotential(AA), CoulombPotential(AB)

Reference runs were performed with 10x more blocks and 10x more steps
than the target short test runs.  From the reference stat.h5 output
files, reduced reference data was produced using check_stats.py.

A summary of the reference files is given below.  The per block or
"stat_trace" data was actually produced from a reference run with
the same number of blocks and 100x more steps than the target short
test runs to reduce the file size.  These stat_trace files are
identical in format to scalar.dat files, but for the reduced full and
partial sums performed on the grid data.

In addition to checking the statistical correctness of full and
partial data sums, check_stats.py also checks that energy density
data written each block sums to match the relevant total, kinetic,
and potential energies written to the scalar.dat file for VMC.
