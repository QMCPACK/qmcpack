1. scf.py is run to compute RHF solution for Neon atom in cc-pvdz
which dumps one- and two-electron integrals in MO basis to plain text
FCIDUMP (not included in repo). Will also dump RHF trial wavefunction
to wfn_rhf.dat.
2. Use conversion script `fcidump_to_qmcpack.py` to generate
Cholesky decomposed integrals in qmcpack format: ham_chol.h5.

.. bash::
    fcidump_to_qmcpack.py -i FCIDUMP -o ham_chol.h5 -v > choldump.out
