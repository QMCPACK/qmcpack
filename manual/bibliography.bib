Using the recently introduced variation-after-response method [E. Neuscamman, J. Chem. Phys. 145, 081103 (2016)], this ansatz allows a crucial orbital optimization step to be performed beyond a configuration interaction singles expansion, while only requiring calculation of two Slater determinant objects. We demonstrate this ansatz for the illustrative example of the stretched LiF molecule, for a range of excited states of formaldehyde, and finally for the more challenging ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene molecule.},

abstract = {We present a way to include non local potentials in the standard Diffusion Monte Carlo method without using the locality approximation. We define a stochastic projection based on a fixed node effective Hamiltonian, whose lowest energy is an upper bound of the true ground state energy, even in the presence of non local operators in the Hamiltonian. The variational property of the resulting algorithm provides a stable diffusion process, even in the case of divergent non local potentials, like the hard-core pseudopotentials. It turns out that the modification required to improve the standard Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm is simple.},

abstract = {We propose improved versions of the standard diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) algorithms. For the DMC method, we refine a scheme recently devised to treat nonlocal pseudopotential in a variational way. We show that such scheme-when applied to large enough systems-maintains its effectiveness only at correspondingly small enough time-steps, and we present two simple upgrades of the method which guarantee the variational property in a size-consistent manner. For the LRDMC method, which is size-consistent and variational by construction, we enhance the computational efficiency by introducing: (i) an improved definition of the effective lattice Hamiltonian which remains size-consistent and entails a small lattice-space error with a known leading term and (ii) a new randomization method for the positions of the lattice knots which requires a single lattice-space.},
