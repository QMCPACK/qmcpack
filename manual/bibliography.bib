@article{Fahy1990,
abstract = {A new method of calculating total energies of solids and atoms using nonlocal pseudopotentials in conjunction with the variational quantum Monte Carlo approach is presented in detail. The many-electron wave function is of the form of a Jastrow exponential factor multiplying a Slater determinant. By using pseudopotentials, the large fluctuations of the energies in the core region of the atoms which occur in quantum Monte Carlo all-electron calculations are avoided. The method is applied to calculate the binding energy and structural properties of diamond, graphite, and silicon. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment. Excellent results are also obtained for the electron affinities and ionization potentials of the carbon and silicon atoms.},

abstract = {We present a way to include non local potentials in the standard Diffusion Monte Carlo method without using the locality approximation. We define a stochastic projection based on a fixed node effective Hamiltonian, whose lowest energy is an upper bound of the true ground state energy, even in the presence of non local operators in the Hamiltonian. The variational property of the resulting algorithm provides a stable diffusion process, even in the case of divergent non local potentials, like the hard-core pseudopotentials. It turns out that the modification required to improve the standard Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm is simple.},

For the DMC method, we refine a scheme recently devised to treat nonlocal pseudopotential in a variational way. We show that such scheme-when applied to large enough systems-maintains its effectiveness only at correspondingly small enough time-steps, and we present two simple upgrades of the method which guarantee the variational property in a size-consistent manner. For the LRDMC method, which is size-consistent and variational by construction, we enhance the computational efficiency by introducing: (i) an improved definition of the effective lattice Hamiltonian which remains size-consistent and entails a small lattice-space error with a known leading term and (ii) a new randomization method for the positions of the lattice knots which requires a single lattice-space.},

When one uses the classical partition H=HSCF+V, the correlation energy increases proportionnai to the number of electrons, quite independently of the shape of the molecule. Another partition, which insures the perturbation matrix to be zero-diagonal, gives a larger 2                  nd                 order correlation energy; the difference between the 2                  nd                 order contributions of these two expressions tends to a constant and is larger for a compact system than for a linear one.
