The goal of this lab is to perform neutral and charged excitation calculations in condensed matter systems using QMCPACK. 
Throughout this lab, a working knowledge of \textit{Lab4 Condensed Matter Calculations} is assumed. 
First, we will introduce the concepts of neutral and charged excitations. 
We will briefly discuss these in relation to the specific experimental studies that must be used to benchmark DMC results. 
Secondly, we will perform charged (quasiparticle) and neutral (optical) excitations calculations on C-diamond.

\section{Basics and excited state experiments}
Although VMC and DMC methods are better suited for studying ground state properties of materials, they can still provide useful information regarding the excited states. 
Unlike the applications of band structure theory such as DFT and GW, it is more challenging to obtain the complete excitation spectra using DMC. 
However, it is relatively straightforward to calculate the band gap minimum of a condensed matter system using DMC. 

We will briefly discuss the two main ways of obtaining the band gap minimum through experiments: photoemission and absorption studies.  
The energy required to remove an electron from a neutral system is called the ionization potential (IP), which is available from direct photoemission experiments. 
In contrast, the emission energy of a negatively charged system (or the energy required to convert a negatively charged system to a neutral system) known as electron affinity (EA) and it is available from inverse photoemission experiments. 
Outline of these experiments are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_exp}. 

Following the explanation in the previous paragraph and Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_exp}, the \textit{quasiparticle} band gap of a material can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
	E_g=EA-IP=(E_{N+1}^{CBM}-E_{N}^{K'})-(E_{N}^{K'}-E_{N-1}^{VBM})=E_{N+1}^{CBM}+E_{N-1}^{VBM}-2*E_{N}^{K'}\label{eq:qp}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of electrons in the neutral system and $E_{N}$ is the ground state energy of the neutral system. 
CBM and VBM stand for the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum, respectively. K' can formally be arbitrary at the infinite limit.
However, in practical calculations, a supertwist which accommodates both CBM and VBM can be more efficient in terms of computational time and systematic finite size error cancellation. 
In the literature, the quasiparticle gap is also called the electronic gap. 
The term electronic comes from the fact that in both photoemission experiments, it is assumed that the perturbed electron is non-interacting with the sample. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Direct and inverse photoemission experiments involve charged excitations, whereas optical absorption experiments involves excitation that are just enough to be excited to the conduction band. From ref. \cite{Onida2002a}}
	\label{fig:lab_ex_exp}
\end{figure}

Additionally, one can also perform absorption experiments where electrons are perturbed at relatively lower energies, just enough to be excited into the conduction band. 
In absorption experiments,  electrons are perturbed at lower energies. 
Therefore, they are not completely free and the system is still considered neutral. 
Since a \textit{quasihole} and \textit{quasielectron} are formed simultaneously, it creates a bound state, unlike the free electron in the quasiparticle gap as described above. 
This process is also known as \textit{optical} excitation, which is schematically shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_exp}, under "Absorption". 
The optical gap can be formulated as follows:
\begin{equation}
E_g^{K_1 {\rightarrow} K_2}=E^{K_1 {\rightarrow} K_2}- E_{0}\label{eq:optical}
\end{equation}
where $E^{K_1 {\rightarrow} K_2}$ is the energy of the system when a valence electron at wavevector $K_1$ is promoted to the conduction band at wavevector $K_2$. 
Therefore, the $E_g^{K_1 {\rightarrow} K_2}$ is called the optical gap for promoting an electron at $K_1$ to $K_2$.
If both CBM and VBM are on the same k-vector then the material is called direct band gap, since it can directly emit photons without any external perturbation (phonons). 
However, if CBM and VBM share different k-vectors, then the photon emitting electron has to transfer some of its momenta to the crystal lattice and then decay to the ground state. 
As this process involves an intermediate step, this property is called the indirect band gap. 
Difference between the optical and electronic band gaps are called the exciton binding energy. 
Exciton binding energy is very important for optoelectronic applications such as lasers. 
Since the recombination usually occurs between free holes and free electrons, a bound electron and hole state means that the spectrum of emission energies will be narrower. 
In the examples that follow, we will investigate the optical excitations of C-diamond.

\section{Preparation for the excited state calculations}\label{sec:lab_ex_prep}

In this section, we will study the preparation steps to perform excited state calculations with quantum Monte Carlo. 
Here, the most basic steps are listed in the implementation order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify the high symmetry k-points of the standardized primitive cell 
	\item Perform DFT band structure calculation along high symmetry paths
	\item Find a supertwist which includes all the k-points of interest
	\item Identify the indexing of k-points in the supertwist to be used in QMCPACK
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Identifying high-symmetry k-points}\label{sec:lab_ex_highk}
Primitive cell is the most basic, non-unique repeat unit of a crystal in the real space. 
However, the translations of the repeat unit, the Bravais lattice is unique for each crystal, and can be represented using discrete translation operations, $R_n$:
\begin{equation}
{\bf R_n} = n_1{\bf a_1} + n_2{\bf a_2} + n_3{\bf a_3}
\end{equation}
$a_n$ are the real space lattice vectors in three dimensions. Thanks to the periodicity of the Bravais lattice, a crystal can also be represented using periodic functions in the reciprocal space:
\begin{equation}
f({\bf R_n + r})= \sum_{m}f_me^{iG_m({\bf R_n+r})}\label{eqn:lab_ex_rec_real}
\end{equation}
where $G_m$ are called as the reciprocal lattice vectors. Equation \ref{eqn:lab_ex_rec_real} also satisfies the equality $G_m\cdot{R_n}=2{\pi}N$. High-symmetry structures can be represented using a subspace of the BZ, which is called as the irreducible Brillouin Zone (iBZ). If we choose series of  paths of high-symmetry k-points which encapsulates the iBZ, we can determine the band gap and electronic structure of the material. For more discussion, please refer to any solid state physics textbook. 

There are multiple practical ways to find the high-symmetry k-point path. 
For example, one can use pymatgen, \cite{Ong2013} XCRYSDEN \cite{Kokalj1999} or SeeK-path \cite{Hinuma2017}. 
Figure \ref{fig:lab_ex_xcrysden} shows the procedure for visualizing the Brillouin Zone using XCRYSDEN after the structure file is loaded. 
However, the primitive cell is not unique, and the actual shape of the BZ can depend on the structure used. 
In our example, we use the python libraries of SeeK-path, using a wrapper written in Nexus. 
SeeK-path includes routines to standardize primitive cells, which will be useful for our work. 
In the \texttt{band.py} script, identification of high symmetry k-points and band structure calculations are done within the workflow. 
In the script, where the \texttt{dia} PhysicalSystem object is used as the input structure, \texttt{dia2\_structure} is the standardized primitive cell and \texttt{dia2\_kpath} is the respective k-path around the iBZ. 
\texttt{dia2\_kpath} has a dictionary of the k-path in various coordinate systems, please make sure you are using the right one. 

\begin{lstlisting}
from structure import get_primitive_cell, get_kpath
dia2_structure   = get_primitive_cell(structure=dia.structure)['structure']
dia2_kpath       = get_kpath(structure=dia2_structure)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/lab_excited_band_si}
	\caption{Band structure calculation of C-diamond performed at DFT-LDA level. Conduction band minimum (CBM) are shown with red points, and the valence band maximum(VBM)  are shown with the green points both at $\Gamma$.  DFT-LDA calculations suggest that the material has an indirect band gap from $\Gamma\rightarrow{\Delta}$. However, $\Gamma\rightarrow{\Gamma}$ transition can also be investigated for more complete check. }
	\label{fig:lab_ex_bands}
\end{figure}

\subsection{DFT band structure calculation along high symmetry paths}
After the high-symmetry kpoints are identified, one can perform band structure calculations in DFT. 
For an insulating structure, DFT can provide VBM and CBM wavevectors which would be of interest to the DMC calculations. 
However, if available, CBM and VBM from DFT would need to be compared to the experiments.  
Basically,  \texttt{band.py} will:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Perform an SCF calculation in QE using a high density reciprocal grid.
	\item Identifies the high-symmetry k-points on the iBZ and provides a k-path.
	\item Perform a 'band' calculation in QE explicitly writing all the k-points on the path. (Make sure to add extra unoccupied bands)
	\item Plot the band structure curves and the location of VBM/CBM if available.
\end{enumerate}
In Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_bands}, C-diamond is shown to have an indirect band gap between the red and green dots (CBM and VBM respectively). 
VBM is located at $\Gamma$. CBM is not located on a high symmetry k-point in this case. 
Therefore, we can use the symbol $\Delta$ to denote the CBM wavevector in the rest of this document. 
In \texttt{band.py} script, once the band structure calculation is finished, you can use the following lines to get the exact location of VBM and CBM using:
\begin{lstlisting}
from pwscf_analyzer import PwscfAnalyzer
p = PwscfAnalyzer(band)
p.analyze()
print "VBM: {0}".format(p.bands.vbm)
print "CBM: {0}".format(p.bands.cbm)
\end{lstlisting}
Output must be the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
VBM:   band_number     = 3
  energy          = 13.6851
  index           = 0
  kpoint_2pi_alat = [0. 0. 0.]
  kpoint_rel      = [0. 0. 0.]
  pol             = up

CBM:   band_number     = 4
  energy          = 17.2861
  index           = 52
  kpoint_2pi_alat = [0.        0.1117088 0.       ]
  kpoint_rel      = [0.3768116 0.        0.3768116]
  pol             = up
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Finding a supertwist which includes all the k-points of interest}
Using the VBM and CBM wavevectors defined in the previous section, we now construct the supertwist which will hopefully contain both VBM and CBM. In Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_twists}, we provide a simple example using 2D rectangular lattice. 
Let us assume that we are interested in the indirect transition, $\Gamma \rightarrow X_1$. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_twists}a, the first BZ of the primitive cell is shown as the square centered on $\Gamma$, which is drawn using dashed lines. Due to the periodicity of the lattice, this primitive cell BZ repeats itself with spacings equal to the reciprocal lattice vectors: (2$\pi$/a, 0) and (0, 2$\pi$/a) (or (1,0) and (0,1) in crystal coordinates). 
We are interested in the  first BZ, where $X_1$ is at (0,0.5). 
In Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_twists}b, the first BZ of the 2x2 supercell is the smaller square, drawn using solid lines. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_twists}c, the BZ of the 2x2 supercell also repeats in the space, similar to Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_twists}a. 
Therefore, in the 2x2 supercell, $X_1$, $X_2$ and $R$ are only the periodic images of $\Gamma$.  2x2 supercell calculation can be performed in reciprocal space using [2,2] tiling matrix. 
Therefore, individual kpoints (twists) of the primitive cell are combined in the supercell calculation, which are then called as supertwists. 
In more complex primitive cell (hence BZ), more general criteria would be constructing a set of supercell reciprocal lattice vectors which contains the $\Gamma \rightarrow X_1$ (e.g. $G_1$ in Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_twists}) vector within their convex hull. 
Under this constraint, Wigner-Seitz radius of the simulation cell can be maximized to in an effort to reduce finite size errors. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/lab_excited_twists}
	\caption{a) First Brillouin Zone (BZ) of the primitive cell centered on $\Gamma$. Dashed lines indicate zone boundaries. b) First BZ of the 2x2 supercell inside the first BZ of the primitive cell. First BZ boundaries of the supercell are shown using solid lines. c) Periodic translations of the first BZ of the supercell showing that $\Gamma$ and $X_1$ are periodic images of each other given the supercell BZ. }
	\label{fig:lab_ex_twists}
\end{figure}

For the case of the indirect band gap in Diamond, one may need to deal with using several approximations to generate a supertwist which corresponds to a reasonable simulation cell. 
$\Delta$ in Diamond band gap is at \texttt{[0.3695653, 0., 0.3695653]}. 
In your calculations, the $\Delta$ wavevector and the eigenvalues you find can be slightly different in value. 
Closest simple fraction to this number with the smallest denominator is 1/3. If we use $\Delta'=[1/3, 0., 1/3]$, we could use 3x1x3 supercell as the simple choice and include both $\Delta'$ and $\Gamma$ in the same supertwist exactly. 
Near  $\Delta$, the LDA band curvature is very low and using  $\Delta'$ can indeed be a good approximation. 
We can compare the eigenvalues using their index numbers:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
>>> p.bands.up[51] ## CBM, $\Delta$ ##
{'eigs': array([-3.2076,  4.9221,  7.5433,  7.5433, 17.1545, 19.7598, 28.3242,
28.3242]), 'index': 51, 'occs': array([1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), 'kpoint_rel': array([0.3695653, 0.       , 0.3695653]), 'kpoint_2pi_alat': array([0.       , 0.1095605, 0.       ])}
>>> p.bands.up[46] ## $\Delta'$ ##
{'eigs': array([-4.0953,  6.1376,  7.9247,  7.9247, 17.1972, 20.6393, 27.3653,
27.3653]), 'index': 46, 'occs': array([1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), 'kpoint_rel': array([0.3333334, 0.       , 0.3333334]), 'kpoint_2pi_alat': array([0.       , 0.0988193, 0.       ])}
\end{lstlisting}
This shows that the eigenvalues of the first unoccupied bands in $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are 17.1545 and 17.1972 eV respectively, meaning that according to LDA, a correction of nearly -40 meV is obtained. 
After electronic transitions between $\Gamma$ and $\Delta'$ are studied using DMC, one can apply the LDA correction to extrapolate the results to $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ transitions.

\subsection{Identifying the indexing of k-points of interest in the supertwist}
At this stage, we must have performed \textit{scf} calculation using a converged k-point grid and then an \textit{nscf} calculation using the supertwist kpoints given above. 
We will be using the orbitals from neutral DFT calculations, therefore we need to explicitly define the band and twist indexes of the excitations in QMCPACK (e.g. in order to define electron promotion).
In C-diamond, we can give an example by finding the band and twist indexes of $\Gamma$ and $\Delta'$. 
For this end, one can run a mock VMC calculation and read \texttt{einspline.tile\_300010003} \texttt{.spin\_0.tw\_0.g0.bandinfo.dat} file. Einspline file prints out the eigenstates information from DFT calculations. 
Therefore, we can obtain the band and the state index from this file, which can later be used to define the electron promotion. 
Below, you can see an explanation of how the band and twist indexes are defined using a portion of the \texttt{einspline.tile\_300010003.spin\_0.tw\_0.g0.bandinfo.dat} file. 
Spin\_0 in the file name suggests that we are reading the spin up eigenstates. Band, state, twistindex and bandindex numbers all start from zero. We know that we have 72 electrons in the simulation cell, where 36 of them are spin-up polarized. 
Since state number starts from 0, state number 35 must be occupied while state 36 should be unoccupied. 
States 35 and 36 have the same reciprocal crystal coordinates (K1,K2,K3) as $\Gamma$ and $\Delta'$, respectively. 
Therefore, one should promote an electron from state number 35 to 36 to study the indirect band gap here. 
\begin{lstlisting}
#  Band State TwistIndex BandIndex Energy Kx Ky Kz K1 K2 K3 KmK
33 33 0  1     0.488302  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000      1
34 34 0  2     0.488302  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000      1
35 35 0  3     0.488302  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000      1
36 36 4  4     0.631985  0.0000 -0.6209  0.0000 -0.3333 -0.0000 -0.3333      1
37 37 8  4     0.631985  0.0000 -1.2418  0.0000 -0.6667 -0.0000 -0.6667      1
38 38 0  4     0.691907  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000      1
\end{lstlisting}
However, one should always check whether this is really what we want. 
It can be seen  that band \# 33, 34 and 35 are degenerate (energy eigenvalues are listed in the 5th column), but also they have the same reciprocal coordinates in (K1,K2,K3). 
This is actually expected as one can see from Fig. \ref{fig:lab_ex_bands}, in the band diagram the band structure is threefold degenerate at $\Gamma$.  
Here, we can choose the state with the largest band index: (0,3). 
Following the (twistindex, bandindex) notation, we can say that $\Gamma$ to $\Delta'$ transition can be defined as from (0,3) to (4,4). 

Alternatively, one can also read the band and twist indexes using PwscfAnalyzer and determine the band/twist indexes on the go:
\begin{lstlisting}
from pwscf_analyzer import PwscfAnalyzer
p = PwscfAnalyzer(nscf)

\section{Quasiparticle (electronic) gap calculations}\label{sec:lab_ex_qp}
In quasiparticle calculations, it is essential to work with reasonably large sized supercells in order to avoid spurious "1/N effects". 
Since quasiparticle calculations involve charged cells, large simulation cells ensure that the extra charge is diluted over the simulation cell. Coulombic interactions are conditionally convergent for neutral periodic systems, but they are divergent for the charged systems. 
A typical workflow for a quasiparticle calculation includes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item SCF calculation in a neutral charged cell with QE using a high-density reciprocal grid.
	\item Choose a tiling matrix which will at least approximately include VBM and CBM k-points. 
	\item 'nscf'/'p2q' calculations using the tiling matrix 
	\item VMC/DMC calculations for the neutral, positively and negatively charged cells in QMCPACK
	\item Check the convergence of the quasiparticle gap with respect to the simulation cell size
\end{enumerate}

Going back to equation \ref{eq:qp}, one can see that it is essential to include VBM and CBM wavevectors in the same twist for quasiparticle calculations as well. 
Therefore, the added electron will sit at CBM while the subtracted electron will be removed from VBM. 
However, for the charged cell calculations, one may need to make changes in the input files for the fourth step.  Alternatively, in \texttt{quasiparticle.py} file the changes in the qmc input are shown for negatively charged system:
\begin{lstlisting}
qmc.input.simulation.qmcsystem.particlesets.e.groups.u.size +=1
qmc.input.simulation.qmcsystem.wavefunction.determinantset.slaterdeterminant.determinants.updet.size += 1
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the number of up electrons are increased by one (negatively charged system), and QMCPACK is instructed to read more one orbital in the up channel from the .h5 file. 

QE uses symmetry in order to reduce the number of k-points required for the calculation. 
Therefore, all symmetry tags in QE (\texttt{nosym}, \texttt{noinv} and \texttt{nosym\_evc}) must be set to false. 
An easy way to check whether this is the case is to see that all KmK values \texttt{einspline} files are equal to 1. 
Above, the input for the neutral cell is given, while the changes are denoted as comments for the positively charged cell. 
Notice that, we have used \texttt{det\_format      = \char`\'old\char`\'} in the \texttt{vmc\_+/-e.py} files.
\section{Optical gap calculations}
Routines for the optical gap calculations are very similar to the quasiparticle gap calculations. 
The first three items in the quasiparticle band gap calculations can be reused for the optical gap calculations. 
However, at the VMC/DMC level, one should explicitly state the electronic transitions that are performed. 
Therefore, compared to the quasiparticle calculations, only the item number 4 is different for optical gap calculations. 
Here, the modified input file is given for the $\Gamma\rightarrow\Delta'$ transition, which can be compared to the ground state input file in the previous section. 
\begin{lstlisting}
<determinantset>
	<slaterdeterminant>
		<determinant id="updet" group="u" sposet="spo_u" size="36">
		    <occupation mode="excited" spindataset="0" format="band" pairs="1" >
					0 3 4 4
		    </occupation>
		</determinant>
		<determinant id="downdet" group="d" sposet="spo_d" size="36">
		    <occupation mode="ground" spindataset="1"/>	
		</determinant>
	</slaterdeterminant>
</determinantset>
\end{lstlisting}
We have used the (twistindex, bandindex) notation in the annihilaion/creation order for the up spin electrons.
After resubmitting the batch job, in the output, you should be able to see the following lines in the \texttt{vmc.out} file:
\begin{lstlisting}
Sorting the bands now:
  Occupying bands based on (ti,bi) data.
removing orbital 35
adding orbital 36
We will read 36 distinct orbitals.
There are 0 core states and 36 valence states.
\end{lstlisting}
And the \texttt{einspline.tile\_300010003.spin\_0.tw\_0.g0.bandinfo.dat} file must be changed in the following way: 
\begin{lstlisting}
#  Band State TwistIndex BandIndex Energy Kx Ky Kz K1 K2 K3 KmK
33 33 0	1 0.499956	0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 1
34 34 0	2 0.500126	0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 1
35 35 4	4 0.637231	0.0000 -0.6209 0.0000 -0.3333 0.0000 -0.3333 1
36 36 0	3 0.502916	0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 1
37 37 8	4 0.637231	0.0000 -1.2418 0.0000 -0.6667 0.0000 -0.6667 1
38 38 0	4 0.699993	0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 0.0000  0.0000 1
\end{lstlisting}
Alternatively, one can define the excitations within Nexus as shown in \texttt{optical.py} file:
\begin{lstlisting}
qmc = generate_qmcpack(
    ...
    excitation     = ['up', '0 3 4 4'], # (ti, bi) notation
    #excitation     = ['up', '-35 + 36'], # Orbital (state) index notation
    ...
    )
\end{lstlisting}
