\end{itemize}

\section{SoA optimizations and improved algorithms}
The Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) optimizations \cite{IPCC_SC17} are a set
of improved data layouts facilitating vectorization on modern CPUs
with wide SIMD units.  \textbf{For many calculations and
  architectures, the SoA implementation more than doubles the speed of
  the code.}  This so-called SoA implementation replaces the older, less efficient
Array-of-Structures (AoS) code and can be enabled or disabled at compile time. The memory footprint is
also reduced in the SoA implementation by better
algorithms, enabling more systems to be run.

The SoA build was made the default for QMCPACK v3.7.0. As described in \ref{sec:cmakeoptions}, the SoA
implementation can be disabled by configuring with \ishell{-DENABLE_SOA=0}.

SoA code path currently does NOT support:
\begin{itemize}
\item Backflow wavefunctions
\item Many observables
\end{itemize}
  
The code should abort with a message referring to AoS vs SoA features
if any unsupported feature is invoked. In this case the AoS build
should be used by configuring with \ishell{-DENABLE_SOA=0}. In
addition, please inform the developers via GitHub or Google Groups so
that porting these features can be prioritized.

Core features are heavily tested in both SoA and AoS versions. If
using untested and non-core features in the SoA code,
please compare the AoS and SoA results carefully.

\section{Supported GPU features}

The GPU implementation supports multiple GPUs per node, with MPI tasks assigned
in a round-robin order to the GPUs. Currently, for large runs, 1 MPI task should
be used per GPU per node. For smaller calculations, use of multiple
MPI tasks per GPU may yield improved performance.

\begin{itemize}
  \item VMC, wavefunction optimization, DMC.
  \item Periodic and open boundary conditions. Mixed boundary conditions are not yet supported.
  \item Wavefunctions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Single Slater determinants with 3D B-spline orbitals. Twist-averaged boundary conditions and complex wavefunctions are fully supported. Gaussian type orbitals are not supported yet.
        \item Hybrid Mixed basis representation in which orbitals are represented as 1D splines times spherical harmonics in spherical regions (muffin tins) around atoms, and 3D B-splines in the interstitial region.
        \item One-body and two-body Jastrows represented as 1D
          B-splines are supported. Three-body jastrow functions are
          not yet supported.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Semilocal (nonlocal and local) pseudopotentials, Coulomb interaction (electron-electron, electron-ion) and Model periodic Coulomb (MPC) interaction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Beta test features}

This section describes developmental features in QMCPACK that might be
ready for production, but require additional testing, features or
documentation to be ready for general use. We describe them here
because they offer significant benefits and are well tested in
specific cases.

\subsection{Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo}

The orbital-space Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFMQC) method is now available in QMCPACK. The main input for the code are the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in a given single particle basis set, which must be produced from a mean-field calculations like Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory. The code is under active development and many features are currently in development. Check the latest version of QMCPACK for an up-to-date description of the available features. A partial list of the current capabilities of the code follows. For a detailed description of the currently available features, see chapter \ref{chap:afqmc}.
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phaseless AFQMC algorithm of Zhang, et. al. (S. Zhang, H. Krakauer, "Quantum Monte Carlo Method using Phase-Free Random Walks with Slater Determinants", PRL 90, 136401 (2003)).
    \item "Hybrid" and "local energy" propagation schemes.
    \item Hamiltonian matrix elements from 1) Molpro's FCIDUMP format (which can be produced by Molpro, PySCF and VASP) and from 2) internal HDF5 format produced by PySCF (see AFQMC section below).
    \item AFQMC calculations with RHF (closed shell doubly occupied), ROHF (open shell doubly occupied) and UHF (spin polarized broken symmetry) symmetry. 
    \item Single and Multi-determinant trial wave-functions. Multi-determinant expansions with either orthogonal or non-orthogonal determinants allowed. 
    \item Fast update scheme for orthogonal multi-determinant expansions.
    \item Distributed propagation algorithms for large systems. Enables calculations where the data structures do not fit on a single node.
    \item Complex implementation for PBC calculations with complex integrals.
    \item Sparse representation of large matrices for reduced memory usage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sharing of spline data across multiple GPUs}

Sharing of GPU spline data enables the distribution of the spline data
across multiple GPUs on a given computational node. For example, on a
two GPU per node system, each GPU would have half of the
orbitals. This enables larger overall spline tables than would fit in
the memory of individual GPUs to be utilized, and potentially up to
the total GPU memory on a node. To obtain high performance, large
electron counts or a high-performing CPU-GPU interconnect is required.

In order to use this feature, the following needs to be done:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS) needs to be utilized
      (e.g. on Summit/SummitDev use "-alloc\_flags gpumps" for
      bsub). If MPI is not detected sharing will be disabled.
    \item CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES needs to be properly set to control each
      rank's visible CUDA devices (e.g. on OLCF Summit/SummitDev one
      needs to create a resource set containing all GPUs with the
      respective number of ranks with "jsrun --task-per-rs Ngpus -g
      Ngpus")
    \item In the determinant set definition of the <wavefunction>
      section the "gpusharing" parameter needs to be set
      (i.e. <determinantset gpusharing="yes">). See Sec. \ref{sec:spo_spline}.
\end{itemize}
