\chapter{Running QMCPACK}
\label{chap:running}

QMCPACK requires at least one xml input file, and is invoked via:

{\ishell{qmcpack [command line options] <XML input file(s)>}}

\section{Command line options}
\label{sec:commandline}
QMCPACK offers several command line options that affect how calculations
are performed. If the flag is absent, then the corresponding
option is disabled.

% unfortunately description is not compatible with much in its []
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-{}-dryrun}]{ Validate the input file without performing the simulation.
  This is a good way to ensure that QMCPACK will do what you think it will. }
\item[\texttt{-{}-enable-timers=none|coarse|medium|fine}]{ Control the timer granularity
  when the build option \ishell{ENABLE_TIMERS} is enabled. }
\item[\texttt{-{}-help}]{ Print version information as well as a list of optional
  command-line arguments. }
\item[\texttt{-{}-noprint}]{ Do not print extra information on Jastrow or pseudopotential.
  If this flag is not present, QMCPACK will create several \ishell{.dat} files
  that contain information about pseudopotentials (one file per PP) and Jastrow
  factors (one per Jastrow factor). These file might be useful for visual inspection
  of the Jastrow, for example. }
\item[\texttt{-{}-verbosity=low|high|debug}]{ Control the output verbosity. The default low verbosity is concise and, for example, does not include all electron or atomic positions for large systems to reduce output size. Use ``high'' to see this information and more details of initialization, allocations, QMC method settings, etc. }
\item[\texttt{-{}-version}]{ Print version information and optional arguments.
  Same as \ishell{--help}. }
\end{description}


\section{Input files}
\label{sec:inputs}
The input is one or more XML file(s), documented in Chapter~\ref{chap:input_overview}.

\section{Output files}
QMCPACK generates multiple files, documented in Chapter~\ref{chap:output_overview}.

\section{Running in parallel with MPI}
\label{sec:parallelrunning}

QMCPACK is fully parallelized with MPI. When performing an ensemble job, all
the MPI ranks are first equally divided into groups that perform individual
QMC calculations. Within one calculation, all the walkers are fully distributed
across all the MPI ranks in the group. Since MPI requires distributed memory,
there must be at least one MPI per node. To maximize the efficiency, more facts
should be taken into account. When using MPI+threads on compute nodes with more
than one NUMA domain (e.g., AMD Interlagos CPU on Titan or a node with multiple
CPU sockets), it is recommended to place as many MPI ranks as the number of
NUMA domains if the memory is sufficient (e.g., one MPI task per socket). On clusters with more than one
GPU per node (NVIDIA Tesla K80), it is necessary to use the same number of MPI
ranks as the number of GPUs per node to let each MPI rank take one GPU.

\section{Using OpenMP threads}
\label{sec:openmprunning}
Modern processors integrate multiple identical cores even with
hardware threads on a single die to increase the total performance and
maintain a reasonable power draw. QMCPACK takes advantage of this
compute capability by using threads and the OpenMP programming model
as well as threaded linear algebra libraries. By default, QMCPACK is
always built with OpenMP enabled. When launching calculations, users
should instruct QMCPACK to create the right number of threads per MPI
rank by specifying environment variable OMP\_NUM\_THREADS. Assuming
one MPI rank per socket, the number of threads should typically be the
number of cores on that socket. Even in the GPU-accelerated version,
using threads significantly reduces the time spent on the calculations
performed by the CPU.

\subsection{Nested OpenMP threads}
Nested threading is an advanced feature requiring experienced users to finely tune runtime parameters to reach the best performance.  

For small-to-medium problem sizes, using one thread per walker or for multiple walkers is most efficient. This is the default in QMCPACK and achieves the shortest time to solution.

For large problems of at least 1,000 electrons, use of nested OpenMP threading can be enabled to reduce the time to solution further, although at some loss of efficiency. In this scheme multiple threads are used in the computations of each walker. This capability is implemented for some of the key computational kernels: the 3D spline orbital evaluation, certain portions of the distance tables, and implicitly the BLAS calls in the determinant update. Use of the batched nonlocal pseudopotential evaluation is also recommended.

Nested threading is enabled by setting \ishell{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS=AA,BB}, \ishell{OMP\_MAX\_ACTIVE\_LEVELS=2} and \ishell{OMP\_NESTED=TRUE} where the additional \ishell{BB} is the number of second-level threads.  Choosing the thread affinity is critical to the performance.  QMCPACK provides a tool qmc-check-affinity (source file src/QMCTools/check-affinity.cpp for details), which might help users investigate the affinity. Knowledge of how the operating system logical CPU cores (/prco/cpuinfo) are bound to the hardware is also needed.

For example, on Blue Gene/Q with a Clang compiler, the best way to fully use the 16 cores each with 4 hardware threads is
\begin{shade}
OMP_NESTED=TRUE
OMP_NUM_THREADS=16,4
MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS=2
OMP_PLACES=threads
OMP_PROC_BIND=spread,close
\end{shade}

On Intel Xeon Phi KNL with an Intel compiler, to use 64 cores without using hardware threads:
\begin{shade}
OMP_NESTED=TRUE
OMP_WAIT_POLICY=ACTIVE
OMP_NUM_THREADS=16,4
MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS=2
OMP_PLACES=cores
OMP_PROC_BIND=spread,close
KMP_HOT_TEAMS_MODE=1
KMP_HOT_TEAMS_MAX_LEVEL=2
\end{shade}

Most multithreaded BLAS/LAPACK libraries do not spawn threads by default
when being called from an OpenMP parallel region. See the explanation in Section~\ref{sec:threadedlibrary}.
This results in the use of only a single thread in each second-level thread team for BLAS/LAPACK operations.
Some vendor libraries like MKL support using multiple threads when being called from an OpenMP parallel region.
One way to enable this feature is using environment variables to override the default behavior.
However, this forces all the calls to the library to use the same number of threads.
As a result, small function calls are penalized with heavy overhead and heavy function calls are slow for not being able to use more threads.
Instead, QMCPACK uses the library APIs to turn on nested threading only at selected performance critical calls.
In the case of using a serial library, QMCPACK implements nested threading to distribute the workload wherever necessary.
Users do not need to control the threading behavior of the library.

\subsection{Performance considerations}
\label{sec:cpu:performance}
As walkers are the basic units of workload in QMC algorithms, they are loosely coupled and distributed across all the threads. For this reason, the best strategy to run QMCPACK efficiently is to feed enough walkers to the available threads.

In a VMC calculation, the code automatically raises the actual number of walkers per MPI rank to the number of available threads
if the user-specified number of walkers is smaller, see ``walkers/mpi=XXX'' in the VMC output.

In DMC, for typical small to mid-sized calculations choose the total number of walkers to be a significant multiple of the total number of
threads (MPI tasks * threads per task). This will ensure a good load balance. e.g. For a calculation on a few nodes with a total
512 threads, using 5120 walkers may keep the load imbalance around 10\%. For the very largest calculations, the target number of
walkers should be chosen to be slightly smaller than a multiple of the total number of available threads across all the MPI ranks.
This will reduce occurrences worse-case load imbalance e.g. where one thread has two walkers while all the others have one.

To achieve better performance, a mixed-precision version (experimental) has been developed in the CPU code. The mixed-precision
CPU code uses a mixed of single precision (SP) and double precision (DP) operations, while the default code use DP exclusively.
This mixed precision version is more aggressive than the GPU CUDA version in using single precision (SP) operations. The Current implementation uses SP on most
calculations, except for matrix inversions and reductions where double precision is required to retain high accuracy. All the
constant spline data in wavefunction, pseudopotentials, and Coulomb potentials are initialized in double precision and later
stored in single precision. The mixed-precision code is as accurate as the double-precision code up to a certain system size, and
may have double the throughput.
Cross checking and verification of accuracy is always required but is particularly important above approximately 1,500 electrons. 

\subsection{Memory considerations}
When using threads, some memory objects are shared by all the threads. Usually these memory objects are read only when the walkers are evolving, for instance the ionic distance table and wavefunction coefficients.
If a wavefunction is represented by B-splines, the whole table is shared by all the threads. It usually takes a large chunk of memory when a large primitive cell was used in the simulation. Its actual size is reported as ``MEMORY increase XXX MB BsplineSetReader'' in the output file.
See details about how to reduce it in Section~\ref{sec:spo_spline}.

The other memory objects that are distinct for each walker during random walks need to be associated with individual walkers and cannot be shared. This part of memory grows linearly as the number of walkers per MPI rank. Those objects include wavefunction values (Slater determinants) at given electronic configurations and electron-related distance tables (electron-electron distance table). Those matrices dominate the $N^2$ scaling of the memory usage per walker.

\section{Running on GPU machines}
\label{sec:gpurunning}

The GPU version for the NVIDIA CUDA platform is fully incorporated into
the main source code. Commonly used functionalities for
solid-state and molecular systems using B-spline single-particle
orbitals are supported. Use of Gaussian basis sets, three-body
Jastrow functions, and many observables are not yet supported. A detailed description of the GPU
implementation can be found in Ref. \cite{EslerKimCeperleyShulenburger2012}.

The current GPU implementation assumes one MPI process per GPU. To use
nodes with multiple GPUs, use multiple MPI processes per node.
Vectorization is achieved over walkers, that is, all walkers are
propagated in parallel. In each GPU kernel, loops over electrons,
atomic cores, or orbitals are further vectorized to exploit an
additional level of parallelism and to allow coalesced memory access.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Performance considerations}
\label{sec:gpu:performance}

To run with high performance on GPUs it is crucial to perform some
benchmarking runs: the optimum configuration is system size, walker
count, and GPU model dependent. The GPU implementation vectorizes
operations over multiple walkers, so generally the more walkers that
are placed on a GPU, the higher the performance that will be
obtained. Performance also increases with electron count, up until the
memory on the GPU is exhausted. A good strategy is to perform a short
series of VMC runs with walker count increasing in multiples of
two. For systems with 100s of electrons, typically 128--256 walkers per
GPU use a sufficient number of GPU threads to operate the GPU
efficiently and to hide memory-access latency. For smaller systems,
thousands of walkers might be required. For QMC algorithms where the number of
walkers is fixed such as VMC, choosing a walker count the is a multiple of the
number of streaming multiprocessors can be most efficient. For
variable population DMC runs, this exact match is not possible.

To achieve better performance, the current GPU implementation uses
single-precision operations for most of the calculations. Double
precision is used in matrix inversions and the Coulomb interaction to
retain high accuracy. The mixed-precision GPU code is as accurate as
the double-precision CPU code up to a certain system size. Cross
checking and verification of accuracy are encouraged for systems with
more than approximately 1,500 electrons. For typical calculations on
smaller electron counts, the statistical error bars are much larger
then the error introduced by mixed precision.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Memory considerations}

In the GPU implementation, each walker has a buffer in the GPU's
global memory to store temporary data associated with the
wavefunctions. Therefore, the amount of memory available on a GPU
limits the number of walkers and eventually the system size that it
can process. Additionally, for calculations using B-splines, this data
is stored on the GPU in a shared read-only buffer. Often the size of the
B-spline data limits the calculations that can be run on the GPU.

If the GPU memory is exhausted, first try reducing the number of walkers per GPU.
Coarsening the grids of the B-splines representation (by decreasing
the value of the mesh factor in the input file) can also lower the memory
usage, at the expense (risk) of obtaining inaccurate results. Proceed
with caution if this option has to be considered.  It is also possible
to distribute the B-spline coefficients table between the host and GPU
memory, see option Spline\_Size\_Limit\_MB in
Section ~\ref{sec:spo_spline}.
