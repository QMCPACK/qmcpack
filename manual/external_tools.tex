This chapter provides some information on using QMCPACK with external tools.

\section{VTune}

Intel's VTune profiler has an API that allows program control over collection (pause/resume) and can add information to the profile data (e.g. delineating tasks).

\subsection{VTune API}

If the variable \texttt{USE\_VTUNE\_API} is set, QMCPACK will check that the
include file (\texttt{ittnotify.h}) and the library (\texttt{libittnotify.a}) can
be found.
To provide CMake with the VTune paths, add the include path to \texttt{CMAKE\_CXX\_FLAGS} and the the library path to \texttt{CMAKE\_LIBRARY\_PATH}.

An example of options to be passed to CMake
\begin{shade}
 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/opt/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe/include \
 -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe/lib64
\end{shade}


\subsection{Timers as Tasks}
To aid in connecting the timers in the code to the profile data, the start/stop of
timers will be recorded as a task if \texttt{USE\_VTUNE\_TASKS} is set.

In addition to compiling with \texttt{USE\_VTUNE\_TASKS}, an option needs to be set at runtime to collect the task API data.
In the GUI, select the checkbox labeled "Analyze user tasks" when setting up the analysis type.
For the command line, set the \texttt{enable-user-tasks} knob to \texttt{true}. For example,
\begin{shade}
amplxe-cl -collect hotspots -knob enable-user-tasks=true ...
\end{shade}

Collection with the timers set at "fine" can generate too much task data in the profile.
Collection with the timers at "medium" collects a more reasonable amount of task data.
